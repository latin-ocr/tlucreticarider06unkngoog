57. quo ε = in quae, as often. Like unde, quo is sometimes applied to

persons; cf. Cic. De Sen. 23, 83 illos . . . quo quidem ine proficiscen-

tem haud sane quid facile retraxerit. 54—7. Seneca quotes these

lineS, and says of the thought (Ep. Mor. 95, 10-11) erras enim, si tibi

illam (philosophiam) putas tantum terrestres operas promittere .· altius

spirat. ‘ Totum‚’ inquit-(philosophia), ‘ mundum scrutor nec me intra con-

tubernium mortale contineo suadere vobis ac dissuadere contenta. magna

me vocant supraque vos posita.’ Cf. below 127 et seq. 58. mate· ξ
riem : of this word Lucr. uses two stems, materie and materia, without ι
difference of meaning3 the former is found only in the nom. and acc. 3

the a-stem is met with twice in the acc.‚ often in the gen„ a few times

in the abl„ but does not occur in Lucr. in the nom—rebus: dat.

after genitalia. 59. reddunda: archaic for reddenda ,· so 1, 707

gignundis. H. 239. 60. suemus: contracted perfect3 so 1, 3013

4, 369. See n. on 70 inritat. For pronunciation, see n. on 216 dis-

soluat.

Wen human lise lay gravelling under religion, it was a Greek
who first forced from Nature her secrete, and made men able to tram-
ple religion underfoot in turn. 62—79.

62 et seq. For the attitude of the Epicureans toward religion, see
Introd. The conception of the Divine and the belief in a hereafter are
deeply impressed upon the constitution of man. It is a characteristic
of human nature to hate one whom you have injured (Tac. Agr. 42).
The Epicuream, however sincere may have been their search after the
truth, in doing violence to the instinctive outreaching of the soul after
God and immortality, felt enraged at the manifestation in otheis of
those beliefs they themselves affected to contemn. The spirit of this
passage is well shown by Taylor Lewis, ‘ Plato against the AtheistS‚’

Excursus lix. : “ The very efforts of the Epicureans to ridicule the ¹
vulgar feam, and to make light of the terrors of the unseen HadeS‚ show

how deeply these awful truthS‚ whatever their origin, had penetrated the
human soul. Even the style in which Lucretius speaks of them betrays
a secret trepidation‚ and, instead of philosophie indifference‚ manifests
that bitter hatred which proceeds from a mind at once deeply troubled,
anxiouS‚ and yet unable to shake off those fear's which its philosophy
affects to despise.'’ Hence the repetition throughout the poem of the
indifference of the gods regarding the affairs of men, and the ground-
lessness of the sear of death. Cf. below 151-8; 3, 16-37 and nn.;
