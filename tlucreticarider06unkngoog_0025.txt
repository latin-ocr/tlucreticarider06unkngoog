LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xxi

of atoms of medium weight. The heaviest of themselves drew

· together, giving rise to the earth ; as this became compact, light,

round particles were squeezed out into the hollow placeS, making
the sea. The earth, formerly moving about, is now stationary,
at tbe centre of the world; it has the shape of a flat cylinder.
From it, when fresh and moist, plants and animals arose.

For the gods the system of Democritus left no room. But in
the course of nature he recognized something that he called
divine, and he seems to have been inclined to an allegorical inter-
pretation of the popular beliefs. Man he revered as nature’s
highest work, dwelling at length upon the symmetry of the human

universe, the law of necessity.

The soul, said DemocrituS‚ is the noblest part of man. The
body is merely its vesse1,2 and should be made subject to it.
The best thing in life is a cheerful contentment. Action should
