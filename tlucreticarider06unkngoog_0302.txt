1t was often omitted also in the older inscriptions, as those of the
Scipios. At that time to glide over the final s in speaking was re-
garded as a mark of refinement, — aS, indeed, it seems to be considered
by some to·day; but when Cicero wrote it was already in bad taste.
Cf. Cic. Orator 161 quin etiam, quodiam subrusticum videtur, olim autem
politius, eorum verborum, quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae,
quae sunt in ⁴ optim u s ’, postremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis
insequebatur. The tendency of the language, however, was fixed, and
s final with other final consonants has entirely disappeared in Italian.
A. 375, a,· G. 7223 H. 608, I. n. 3. 160. genus: supply rerum.
The limiting genitive with genus is often omitted; cf. 2, 447 ; 3, 483.
The argument here is precisely that of Epicurus: ‘First, indeed,
(we are to admit) that nothing is produced from the non-existent3
for (if it could be) everything would be produced from everything3
of seedS, at least, nothing would have need.’ See Diog. Laert. 10,
24, 38. 161. mare ε the abl. ends regularly in i, as 6, 8903 mare is
occasionally found in other writerS. See Roby, ‘ Gr.’429. Neue gives
full list of exampleS, ‘ Formenlehre,’ 1. 229—230. 162. squami-
gerum: gen. pl.; cf. 2, 1083 and n. on 1 dz'vom. This word is first
met with in Cicero’s translation of the ‘ Phaenomena’ of Aratus, 328
(574) exin squamigeri serpentes ludere pisces, whence the poet likely
drew it; for he seems to have studied with admiration this youthful
work of Cicero’s, and in many instances to have been indebted to it.
163. armenta: armenta an‘d pecudes are both tame animals as opposed
to genus-ferarum ,· the former word refers to the larger sort, especially
plough-oxen and horses; the latter to the smaller, as the lesser cattle,
sheep, goats etc. See Diiderlein, ‘Lat. Synonyms.’ 164. tene-
rent: like posset above and the following subjunctives, a verb of an
apodosis whose protasis is to be supplied from 159. 166. ferre etc. ε
omnes arbores omnis-fructus (i.e. onmia fructuum genera) firre possent.
167. ubi: almost = si ‚· so also cum is sometimes used to introduce
a conditional clause. —genitalia corpora: see n. to 55 primordia.
168. qui: old abl. with the force of an adv.: ‘ how could things have
a fixed, unvarying mother ? ' 169. at nunc: ‘ but as it is! At is
often used to introduce an objection to a preceding statement, some-
times correcting the false with the true as here, sometimes bringing
forward a conflicting statement that is to be met, as 803, where see n.
