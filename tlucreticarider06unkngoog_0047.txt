LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xliii

Even Boyle thought that the atoms cohere by reason os their
jagged shapes. The three agreed, however, in looking to the
power of God as final cause in the building up of things out of
atomS. With the discovery of thelaw of gravitation the course
of physical speculation was changed. Gradually the doctrine
of attraction and repulsi0n‚ the conception of forces acting im-
mediately in the relations of atoms one with another, was intro·
duced. The new principle seemed so potent and wide-reaching
in its application, that an all-moving spirit hardly seemed neces-
sary in accounting for the on-going of the universe. A tendency
to the mechanica] explanation of nature became manifest. In
accordance with the spirit of this, Locke formulated his doctrine
of sensationalism‚ which so harmonized with the trend of the
'times that it was most widely adopted as embodying the true
theory of knowledge. The unfolding and application of its doc-
trines revolutionized European speculation‚ leading directly to
the French “ Illumination,” with the rise of a materialistic theory
os the universe and a utilitarian theory of morals. At present,
the mechanica! explanation of nature under the form of the
evolution hypothesis is again struggling for the mastery.
The atom of modern science is the atom of Lucretius without

the power of swerving. But Lucretius had no proper concep-
tion of force. Here at once his physical theory breaks down.
For the doctrine of attraction he had only the poor substitute of
varied shapes of atoms to keep them in combination. Repulsion,
indeed, he foreshadowed in the importance he attached to the
rebounding of atoms' and masses after impact: but without the
assumption of force this rebounding is inconceivable‚ because
the atoms are considered absolutely hard, and hence must be
inelastic. For the inherent downward tendency of atomS, mod-
ern science substitutes vibratory motion ; it agrees with Lucre-
tius in supposing the movements of atoms to be inconceivably
swift. It agrees with him also in believing that all the processes
of nature take place in accordance with certain laws of universal
sway and invariable action. For a final cause the theistic physi-
cist looks to an all-intelligent, all-potent God, who gave to atoms
