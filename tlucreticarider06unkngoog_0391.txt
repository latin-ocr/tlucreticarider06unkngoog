926-7. Death is less to us than sleep, if there can be a less than

nothing. The Epicureans thought that in sleep a portion of the sou]
left the body. Literature is full of passages based upon the likeness
of death to sleep. - The conception of sleep, as the brother of death,

goes back as far as Homer3 see 11. 16, 682 ; Shelley‚ ‘Queen Mab,’
1st stanza3 Lessing, ‘ How the Ancients represented Death.' Cf.

Cic. De‘Sen. 22, 80 iam vero videtis nihil esse morti tam simile quam
somnum ,· Id. Tusc. Disp. 1, 38, 92 quid curet autem, qui ne sentit qui-
dem .? habes somnum imag-inem mortis eamque cotidie induis, et dubitas
quin sensus in morte nullus sit, cum in eius simulacro videas esse nullum
sensum ,³²- Both Lucretius and Cicero seem to have been thinking of
the heavy, dreamless sleep, and were not troubled with the apprehen·
sions that vexed Hamlet :—
“ To die,—to sleep:-

To sleep Ι perchance‚ to dream: ay, there 's the rub ;

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.”

Cf. the ‘ Systeme de la Nature,’ part 1, ch. 13: “ But does not a

” profound sleep help to give him a true idea of this nothing? Does

not that deprive him of everything? Does it no't appear to annihilate
the universe to him, and him to the universe? Is death anything
more more than a profound, a permanent sleep?”

(6) What could we say, save that her cause is just, if Nature should
thus address us: ‘ Why, 0 mortal, grieve that thou must die ? If a glad
life has been thy lot, why not depart content ἓ if life is irksome, why not
end it? Shouldst thou never die there is nothing new in storesor thee.'
If an old man should mourn at death, would she not rightly chide ? —
‘ Hence with thy tears, trtfler! Thou hast let thy list slip away asailure‚
the fault is thine own ,· make room for others.' To none is life given in
perpetuity. As the past was before our birth, so shall the future be aster

death. 931—977.
