330 ‘ LUCRETIUS [111. 931-

931. rerum natura: see n. to 1, 21. For a similar discourse of
Nature, suggested probably by the present passage, see the ‘ Systeme
de la Nature,’ the last chapter3 also Lange, ‘ Hist. of Materialism,'
ii. 122—3. 932. mittat: see n. to 1, 572. 936. pertusum in
vas: the daughters of Danaus for the killing of their husbands were
said to have been allotted in Hades the punishment of pouring water
forever into jars fullos holes; see Ov. Her. 143 Hor. Od. 3, 11, 25;
Tib. 1, 3, 79. Hence a proverb seems to have been derived, congerere
(ingerere) in pertusum dolium (vas). Cf. Plaut. Ps. 1, 3, 135. 938-9.
Cf. Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 117-9.

inde fit ut raro qui se vixisse beatum
dicat, et exacto contentus tempore vita
cedat uti conviva satus, reperire queamus.

940. quae . . . cumque: tmesis. Frui, like fimgi and compounds
(so perficnctus 956 below), in prae-Ciceronian writers is sometimes con-
strued with the acc. 943. Supply cur. Cf. n. to 81. 944-5. Cf.
Cic. De Sen. 23, 85 nam habet natura, ut aliarum omnium rerum, sic
vivendi modum 3 Id. ib. 21, 76 omnino . . . rerum omnium satietas vitae
facit satietatem ‚· Eccles. 1, 9: ‘⁴ The thing that hath been, it is that
which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done;
and there is ,no new thing under the sun '’ ; M. Aurel. Ant. Med. 7, 1.

Juvenal, with different underlying thought, exclaimS, —

nil erit ulterius, quod nostris moribus addat
posteritas: eadem cupient facientque minores.

948. saecla: see n. to 1, 202. 950-1. The form of expression is
taken from the law3 intendere litem is ‘ to bring in a charge ' against
one ; causam is like our “ case.” 956. perfunctus ε see n. to 940.
959. nec : = non, as in the legal phrase res nec manctjni, nec mani-
festum, neg-otium, negligere etc. 961. aliena tua aetate t ‘ unsuited
to thy time of life '; for the abl. cf. Cic. de Off. 1, 13, 4¹ homine alie-

. nissimum. Lucr. has alienus also with the gen. (3, 8213 6, 693 6, 1065),
·· and once with the dat. (6, 1119). 962. agedum : an early correc-

tion, adopted also by Lachmann and Bernays, for agendum of uss.—
magnus: for magnis of Mss. ; Lachmann reads ἠπίη Bernays
gnatzk. The reading magnus is at best awkward: the meaning is ‘in
a manner befitting a great-souled person,’ ‘with dignity.’ 964-5-
Cf. 1, 263-4 and n. 966. nec quisquam : the matter of which a
