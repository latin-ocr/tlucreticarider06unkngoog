ἐκ τῶν ὁμοιομερῶν μικρῶν σωμάτων τὸ πᾶν συγκεκρίσθω. Other
examples are cited by Zeller, ut sup. p. 334-5. 834. quom: anti-
classical form of oum, indicating its derivation from the pronomina]
root KVA, Lat. qni ; probably an old accusative. cum is the more
common form in the Mss. of Lucretius3 quom, in those of Plautus
and Terence. 836. hic ε i.e., Anaxagoras3 subject of putat below.
837. viscus: the singular is rare3 it occurs again 3, 7193 3, 266.
Neue gives other passages where it is found, ‘ Formenlehre,' i. 447-8.
—sanguen τ = sanguinem ‚- a neuter form was developed by the side
of the masc„ but went out of use in the classical period. 843. Anax.
taught that by the mixture of different kinds of substances there is
made up a universe without void. 844. See n. to 830. 846. illi:
Empedocles etc. ; see 734 et seq.

Again, in that he assumes sofl first—beginnings, which would soon
peruls-h. 847-858.

848. si . . . sunt: ‘if (those really) are first-beginnings.’ 849.
sunt: for constant. After atque or ac expressing comparison, ‘tham'
‘aS,' the verb is 'usually omitted. Cf. 846 atque illi. 850. Anax„
however, held that the particles, though divisible to infinity, were
imperishable. 852. leti etc.: cf. the Eng. expression, ‘in the very
jaws of death.’ 855. manifesta := φαινόμενα in its philosophical
use, ‘evident to the senses.' So 2, 8673 3, 3 533 and in other places,

manif in the ordinary signification occurs below 893. 856. ex:
‘ before! 857. reccidere ε see n. on 228- redducit. Here the cl of

red was assimilated to the following c. In classical Latin, generally,
one c was dropped and the e made short. 858. ante : 150-264.

Furtlzermore‚ since food causes the body to increase, blood, bone, and
other parts os the body must be composed of things dff’rent in kind ,· or, if
it is supposed that from fhod, bones, blood, and sinews take up particles of
like nature with themselves, then food must be made up ospartr'cles dtffl’r-
ent in kind ,· the same reasoning applies to tlte products of the earth, and

lo other things. 859-874.

860. scire licet : frequent in Lucr.; ‘you are to know.' After 860
doubtless a line has been lost. Lambinus thus supplies its place,

well continuing the argument 2 —

et nervos alienigenis ex partibus esse.
