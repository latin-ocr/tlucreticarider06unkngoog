all science the Epicureans laid great stress. See Zeller, ⁸ StoicS, Epi·

often placed between thern, — a usage by the old grammarians called

That nothing can be produced from nothing was a doctrine common to
all the ancient physicists as well as to modern materialists. Who first
definitely formulated it is not known; before the time of Aristotle it
seems to have become current as a physical axiom. This line of Lucr.
has been interpreted to mean that nothing can happen without ade-
quate cause (see T ait and Stewart, ‘The Unseen Uniyersess p. 132),—
a teaching that held a prominent place in the Stoic philosophy; but
a comparison with the statement of Epicurus, whom Lucr. so closely
followed, shows clearly that the reference is to the coming of the
existent out of the non-existent. Cf. Haeckel, ‘ Nat. Hist. of Crea-
tion,’ ch. 1: “ Never yet has an instance been observed of even the
smallest particle of matter having vanished, or even of an atom being
added to the already existing mass.’' Praetically, indeed, in the hands
of the experimenter matter is indestructible, and is hence inferred to
be without beginning; but the modern materialists are as a rule less
dogmatic regarding its eternal existence than the ancient. See
Haeckel, ut sup. ,· Herbert Spencer, ⁸ First Principles‚’ Part 2, ch. 4.
The denial that by any agency matter can come into existence from
nothing involves necessarily its eternal pre-existence; and this vio-
lates the law of causality. For matter, in'the ordinary acceptation of
