342 LUCRETms [V. 160-

184; with voluisse supply eos referring to deum above. 160. nec
fas etc.: ‘and that it is impious to shake from its firm seats that
which in old time by the forethought of the gods was based on ever·
lasting foundations ’ (lit. ‘ never-ending time ') etc. The reference is to
the great fabric of superstition. 165-7. For the thought cf. Cic.
N. D. 1, 9, 23 an haec, ut fere dicitis, hominum causa a deo constituta
sunt ? sapientiumne ? propter paucos igitur tanta est rerum sacta molitio.
an stultorum ἓ at pn‘mum causa non ficit, cur de inprobis bene mereretur.
168. quietos etc.: explained by the first of the κύριαι δόξαι (Diog.
Laert. 10, 139, ό) ‘whatever is happy and immortal neither has trouble
itself nor <auses trouble to another '; cf. Cic. N. D. 1, 17, 45 and 19, 5¹·
171. aegri: cf. 3, 832 and n. 174. credo: sarcastic, but at best
an awkward reading3 Munro proposes crepera—vita: i.e.‚ divom.
With the thought of 171-5 cf. Cic. N. D. 1, 9, 21 ab utroque (the Stoic
and the Platonist) autem sciscitor, cur mundi aedificatores repente exsti·
terim, innumerabilia saecla dormierint ; 1, 9, 22 isto igitur tam inmenso
spatio, quaero, Balbe (Stoic) cur πρόνοια. vestra cessaverit. laboremque
ficgiebat ? . . . quid autem erat quod concupisceret deus mundum signis et
luminibus tamquam aedilis ornare ? si, ut deus ipse melius habitaret, antea
videlicet tempore infinito in tenebris tamquam in gurgustio habitaverat.
176. creatis: attracted from the acc. to agree with nobis. Cf. Hor.
Sat. 1, 1, 19 atqui licet (eis) esse beatis. 177. Enim quicumque natus
est, debet etc. Cf. 3, 1081 and n. 180. numero: i.e.‚ viventium.
182. notities : used by Lucr.‚ as Munro explains, to express the
πρόληψις of EpicuruS, a preconception or notion of the mind laid-up,
‘⁶ that is to say, a recollection of what has repeatedly appeared from
without.'’ What model or form of man (exemplum) could the gods
ever see, that they could store up in mind a conception or notion
(notities) to work from? Ov. Met. 1, 83 says that man was made

in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum. 184. principiorum: see
n. to 1, 55. 185. possent: see n. to 1, 586. 187-191 ==
422-6. 188. plagis : see n. to 1, 528. 192-4. Cf. 1, 1026-8.

194. haec rer. summat see n. to 1, ²35·

(3) Even if I knew not tlte first-beginnings os things, I should be cer-
tain that the gods did not make this world for man, because there
is so much in it all awry and bad. By far the largn part of
the earth cannot be dwelt on, while bramffles, droughts, flwds,
