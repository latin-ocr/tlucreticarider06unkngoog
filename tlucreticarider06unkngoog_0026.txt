With Socrates came a change in the trend of Greek thought.
Cicero says of him that ‘he called philosophy down from heaven,
and made her to dwell in citieS, and brought her even to men's
houseS‚ and caused her to make inquiry about life and character
and things good and evil.'⁴ The attention of philosopher-s was
’ now directed not so much to the problem of the universe as to
that of man, to settling the vexed questions of human life. But
Socrates was too broad a man to be sully comprehended by his
generation. Most of the schools that owed their originative
impulse to his teachings reflected these only partially andxim-
perfectly. Two in particular, the Cynic and the CyrenaiC,
grasped each but a single phase of doctrine, and made it alone
the basis of a system of morals; hence were developed two
ethical theories diametrically opposed t'o each other. Socrates
taught the intimate relation between virtue and happiness. He
enjoined the life of virtue, which he made to consist in actions
directed solely by reason under all circumstances ; but he clearly
conceived as an aim to this only the happiness resulting there-
from. Antisthenes and 'the Cynics expanded the virtue-aspect
