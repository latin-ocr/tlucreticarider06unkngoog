retain many traces of this e. intermediate between the a of the simple
verb and the later i.’' 240 sensiferos: found only in Luer. Cf. n.
to ι, 27 5. 241 etc. lt would be hard to find an instance of more ‘⁵
utterly groundless speculation than here presented. “ The difficulty of
fixing the exact seat of sensation is in the most important point com-
pletely evaded by the Epicurean system; and in spite of the immense
progress of physiology. the Materialism of the last century found itself
at precisely the same point. The individual atoms do not feel, or their
feelings could not be fused together, since void space, which has no
substratum, cannot conduct sensation,¹and still less partake of it. We
must, therefore, constantly fall back on the solution‚—the motion ,
of the atoms is sensation. Epicurus, and with him Lucretius, in vain
seeks to veil this point by saying that, besides the subtle atoms
‘that make up the three other parts of the soul,’ there is still a fourth
constituent associated with thern, wholly without name, and of the “
utmost fineness and mobility, which forms the soul of the soul. But
with regard to these subtlest soul-atoms the difficulty still remains the
same as it also does for the vibrating hrain-filaments of De la Met-
trie.” Lange, ‘Hist. of Materialism,' i. 146-7. To explain the origin of
sense or feeling, and the source of the impulse of, voluntary movement,
is a hard nut for materialists to crack. Epicurus and Lucr. are not
the only ones that have taken refuge in something unknown and
unknowable. 242. east: see n. to ι, ιο. It has been suggested
that perhaps Epicurus derived his idea of this fourth essence from the
quintessence of Aristotle. 246. figuris: see n. to 190. First ,
the fourth element or essence is stirred; this transfers motion and
feeling to the beat-clement, this in turn to the wind, the wind to the
air-element ς hence blood, vitaIS, finally bone and marrow, receive the
impulse. ‘⁸ Epicurus appears to have supposed, in sharp contrast
with our theory of the conservation of force, that a subtle body may
pass on its own movement to a heavier, independently of the bulk,
and this in turn to a still heavier: so that the sum of mechanical
work done, instead of remaining stationary, goes on multiplying from
step to step.” Lange, ut supra. 247. motus: acc. 252. huc:
i.e., to the seat of this fourth subtle element of the soul. 256. ‘ But
generally a stop is put to (these hurtful) motions on the surface, as it
were, of the body.’
