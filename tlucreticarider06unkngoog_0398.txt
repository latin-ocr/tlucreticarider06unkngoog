appealed to the Romans. Speculation for its own sake met with ·no
encouragement among them. Cf. 1, 146-ss and n. With ιο edd.

compare Eun. Ann. (Vahlen) 227:

nec quisquam sophiam sapientia quae perhibetur
in somnis vidit prius quam sam discere coepit z

where as in 10 and Hor. Od. 1, 34, 2 sapientia is used for philosophia.
η. For the arrangement of words cf. 1, 22-3 and n„ 14. Notice
the double alliteration in fer. fru. and Lib. liq. ; see n. to 1, 14.—
Liber: sometimes called by the Greeks εὑρετὴς ἀμπέλου. 15. vi-
tigeni: cf. 6, 1072 vitigeni latices ; vitigenus is Lucretian for viti-
gineus. — instituisse: ambiguous3 “ is it merely ‘introduced and
set up,' as Cic. ad Fam. 13, 48 ea te instituere quae sequantur alii ; or
does it imply the planting also of the vine and sowing of the corn, as
Cic. de Lege Agr. 2, 67 iugera cce, ubi institui vineae possunt? '’
Munro inquires. The form'er interpretation seems to me more in

harmony with the context. 17. gentis: on the form see n. to 1, 7.
Lambinus refers to Diodorus Siculus lib. 5 for an account of some

,“ peoples ignorant of grain and wine. Consult Morgau, ‘Ancient

Society,' Part 1, ch. 2. 20. per magnas etc.: Epicureanism be-

came widely disseminated, especially in Italy, at a comparatively
early date. A chief reason assigned for its popularity is, that its

doctrines could be readily understood; but doubtless the fact that it
made pleasure the standard of action appealed to many. Cf. Cic.
De Fin: 1, 7, 25 quaeritur saepe cur tam multi sint Epicurei ; sunt aliae
quoque causae, sed multitudinem haec maxime adlicet, quod ita putant
dici ab illo, recte et honesta quae sint, ea facere ipsa per se laetitiam, id est
voluptatem ,· also Id. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3, 7 (Epicurei) Italiam totam occu-
paverunt, quodque maximum argumentum est non dici illa subtiliter,
quod ‘et tam facile ediscantur et ab indoctis probentur, id illi firmamentum
esse disciplinae putant. Cf. n. to 336-7.

22. Hercules: here follows a comparison between the victories
of Hercules and those of Epicurus. Eight of the labors of Hercules
are referred to, the slaying of the Nemaean lion, the capture of the
Erymanthian boar, the bringing of the Cretan bull to Erystheus‚ the
destruction of the Lernean hydra, the fetching of the oxen of Geryon,
the driving away of the Stymphalian birds, the taking of the flesh-
