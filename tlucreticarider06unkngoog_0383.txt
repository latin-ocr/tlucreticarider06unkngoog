713 et seq. The argument rests upon belief in the spontaneous gen· '

eration of worms and other forms of life in deeaying bodies. Spon-
taneous generation is a necessary postulate of materialistic evolution.
Within the past few years every effort has been made to show that it is
not merely possible, but under certain conditions inevitable. In every
test the appearance of organized life has been shown to be the result
of the presence of germs3 and the attempts to make protoplasm have
utterly failed. The entire trend of scientific investigation goes to
establish the old maxim, omne vivum ex vivo. Still, even to-day there

are many who believe, as Lucretius did, that the ca'rcass of itself goes ·

over into worms. It is no uncommon thing to hear people say that
they have seen horse-hairs become alive. Consult Huxley, ‘ Origin of
Species‚' sect. 3; Haeckel, ‘Nat. Hist. of Creati0n‚' ch. 133 Lange,
‘ Hist. of Materialism,' iii. 17 et seq. ,· Guthrie, ‘ Mr. Spencer’s For·
mula of Evolution,’ pp. 230-1 ; Bowne, ‘ Review of Herbert Spencer‚’
ch. 33 Elam, ‘Winds of Doctrine,' ch. 53 Wainwright, ‘Scientific

SophismS,' ch. 73 Flint, ‘Anti-Theistic Theories,' p. 164 et seq. .
