teaching of the'Stoics that the world is perfect; cf. Cic. N. D. 2, 14
37 scite enim Ch ryst'ppus, ut clrspei causa involucrum, vagmam autem gla-
dii, sic praeter mundum cetera omnia aliorum causa esse generata, ut eas
fruges atque fructus, quos terra gignit, animantium causa, animantis au-
tem hominum, ut equum vehendi causa, arandi bovem, venandi et custo-

natural and moral evil has always vexed the minds of the thoughtfulg
thus the Preacher exclaims (Eccl. i. 14-15), ‘ I have seen all the works
that are done under the sun ; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation

merely to denote size‚ as Munro remarks in n. to 4, 416 inpete, a signi-
fication derived from the primary meaning of force and vehemence;
there seems to be no allusion here to the revolution of the heavenS‚
though that is usually involved in the expression impetus caeli.
201. inde: ‘of it‚’ a meaning that survives in the French en.—
avidei: for avidam of MSS-3 Lachmann has aliquam, Bernays avide.

bidenti: a kind of heavy hoe, differing from the common hoe (ras-
trum) in having two prongs. 1t was used sometimes instead of a
