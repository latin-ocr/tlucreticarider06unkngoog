duced by the action of the sun’s heat upon the moist earth, the ‘⁶ pri-
mal slime,’' as Zeller calls it. St. Augustine accounted for the apparent
spontaneous generation of minute living things by declaring that ati
the beginning of the world, when God created man and the other ani· ἰ
maIS, he made also an infinite number of invisible seeds, which are
present in all the elements and develop into life under the right
conditions of heat and moisture. 805. tibi z see n. to 1, 673. —-

eternal spring, its rivers of milk and honey, its crops springing with-

The modern advocates of materialistic evolution have found it diffi-
cult to explain why at the beginning the lowest forms of life'were
spontaneously produced from the earth and to-day similar forms are
not still produced (for there is not a particle of evidence to show that
spontaneous generation is going on at present) ; and why those lowest
forms have not all worked up to a higher plane of existence, instead
of showing no essential change of type in the vast periods of time
that have elapsed since remains of life began to be fossilized in the
rocks. To the first question no one has offered a solution more satis—
factory than that proposed by our poet in these two lines. 829.
