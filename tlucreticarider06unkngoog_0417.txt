in piace3 then a third air-current causes the revolution of the
heavens by blowing either over the sphere or under3 in the last case
the motion is produced just as the current of a stream turns a
water-wheel.—aera: the air-current holds a most important place in
the explanation of phenomena both celestial and terrestrial by thel
ancients. It was employed by Anaximander to explain the move-j
ment of the heavenly bodies3 by Anaximenes, to account for the-circmff
lar form of their orbits; by EmpedocleS, to show the reason for the·
inclination of the earth's axis toward the path of the sun ; by Arche-5
laus (follower of Anaxagoras) and others to account for the steady.'
position of the earth in the world3 by DemocrituS‚ MetrodoruS, and
the EpicureanS, to explain the cause of earthquakes (cf. 6, 535-607)..
Cf. also the Stoic doctrine that “ all attributes by means of which one¹
object is distinguished from another are produced by the existence
of certain air-curteum, which emanate from the centre of an object,
diffuse themselves to its outer limus, and having reached the surface, ,
return again to the centre to constitute the inward unity3 ’² by some, Ι
moreover, air-currents were given no small significance in the expla- ·
nation of the soul. In many cases it seems as if the ancient philos- '¹
ophers, when they had come across a great mystery and wished to
heed the dictum expressed in Horace’s nec deus intersit, took refuge
in an air-current, instead of a god, as unseen cause. 514. aeterni :

give this form, which is generally taken as a wrong reading or an ³
equivalent of immania. It is better explained, however, as derived ⁵
from Summanus, the name of an ancient divinity who was thought ;
to preside over the nocturnal sky and to wield the lightnings that .·
appear in the night3 there was a temple for his worship near the
Circus MaximuS, and in the pediment of the temple οἱ the Capitoline
Jupiter there was a representation of him. Summania templa, then,
as Munro interpretS, refers to the nightly sky3 trans. ⁴ heaven’s Sum· ξ

language‚ which strictly interpreted would be inconsistent with his
system. The thought is, that the heavenly bodieS, gathering to them·
selves matter to repair waste, naturally move whithersoever the atoms
adapted to them are found in greatest abundance; for to different
