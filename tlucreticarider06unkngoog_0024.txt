ered as having existence equally with the former.¹ Matter is
made up of particles which are invisible, underived, indivisible‚·
impenetrable, imperishable,—the atoms. These are all alike
in nature, and of the same specific gravity. They differ in ⁸
form, being of numberless shapes3 hence also in size and
weight. They are distinguished, moreover‚ by differences in
arrangement, or order, and position. They are the changeless
substrate underlying everything. The atoms are always mov-
ing3 their natural movement is downward in straight lineS, be-
cause of their weight. All things are made up of combinations
of atoms. In every combination there is void, as only the
atoms are perfectly solid. Things undergo change by the shi'ft- ι
ing about of atoms in different order and relative positions.
The various qualities that are perceived in things are not prop-
erties of the atom, but accidental properties of the combination.
Life thus is an accident of certain atom groupS. There are four
combinations of special permanency and importance‚ inasmuch
as they are wrought into many otherS,—fire‚ air, water, and
earth.2

As space is unlimited and atoms are numberleSS, there is an
infinite number of worldS. These are all the time coming into
existence, dissolving back into atoms. As the atoms fall in
infinite space the heavier go faster than the lighter, impinging
upon them3 these are forced upward and sidewise‚ get entangled
because of the different shapeS‚ and form thus a mass to which
the composition of motions gives a rotary movement. The mass
receives constant additions as it goes whirling through the
cloud of falling particleS‚ and in time a world is produced. This
result happens by the law of necessity. From such a combina-
tion our world came. As the atoms settled together the lighter
were forced out. The lightest formed a close enveloping cir-
cumference‚ or sphere; those of more weight, the heagenly
bodieS, which caught fire from moving in the air, itself composed
