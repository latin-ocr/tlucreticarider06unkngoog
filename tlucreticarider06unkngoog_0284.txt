the syncopated form. 21. quae: the necessary English trans,
‘ thou ’ fails to bring out the relation with the preceding thought
which the relative in the more accurate and subtle Latin idiom
expresses.

rerum naturam: Lucretius uses natura in many different senses·
Here and in 2 5 by natura rerum is meant what we often understand
by ‘nature,’—the sum and system of things existent3 as Humboldt
defines it (⁴Cosm08,’ tr. by otte, Introd.): ‘⁴ Nature considered ra-
tionally. that is to say, submitted to the process of thought, is a
unity in diversity of phenomena 3 a harmony, blending together of
all created thingS, however dissimilar in torm and attributes3 one
great whole (τὸ πᾶν) animated with the breath of life.’' Often our
poet personifies patu-ge, regards her as a mysterious living presence,
that “makes herself felt as a peculiar and independent power..” cf.
especially 2, 1090-92: ‘ If you keep in mind these things well
thought out, nature untrammelled at once and free from haughty
masters is seen of her own accord by herself without the power of
the gods to do all things.’ The idea of a will behind all movement
is so firmly impressed upon the minds of men that, strive as they may
to believe in pure chance or necessity, they generally end by personi-
fying something. Fate in antiquity was only a personification of
natural law. It is a significant fact that materialists of our own time
often spell matter and evolution with capital letters. Evolutiom a
proceSS, takes the place of a deity, and matter is thought to contain
the ‘⁶ promise and potency of all terrestrial life ” (Tyndall). ‘⁴ It
seems almost a matter of taste whether we worship the masculine God,
the feminine Nature, or the neuter All.” Lange, ‘ Hist. of Material-
ism,’ tr. iii. 340. On Lucretius’ conception of Nature as a person·
ality, see Ritter, ⁴ Hist. of Ancient Philosophy,' Bohn's ed. iv. 87-88.
, Lucr. also uses the word natura to express ‘natural constitution’ of
a thing, ‘ substance,’ and the like. ¹ ”

serve the chiasmus. A. 344, f; G. 6843 H. 562. A like arrange·
ment of words often adds a charm to English style, as in Milton’s
“dulcet symphonies and voices sweet.’' 22. luminis oras: a
favorite expression of Lucr., by which he suggests the dim bordet-
land between that which is and that which is not, the existent and the
non-existent. See Munro's note. 25. de rerum natura: whence
Lucr. drew the title of his work can only be conjectured. Περὶ φύ-
