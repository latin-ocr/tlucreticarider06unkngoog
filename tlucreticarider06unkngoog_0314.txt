κινήσεως, to which it bears an apparent resemblance, and which is ex·
pressed in Latin by princ-epium motus, ‘ principle of motion.’ Void is
looked upon not as the cause but as the necessary condition of move-
ment. Cf. Arist. Phys. 3, 1, 2. 384. de ε ‘ after ’ς but see Munro’s
note. 390. ille3 as is above, refers to aer. The air rushing in can-
not fill the entire space at once3 it will first flow into the various parts,
one after another, then finally the whole space will be taken up by
it. —omnia·. i.e. omnia loca ,· omnes might have been expected from
the preceding locum ,· but Lucr. has both forms of the pl. With the
change of gender here cf. 1, 351-2 arbusta . . . totas; 1, 450 rebus . . .
horum. 392. id fieri: i.e. that air is found between bodies im-
mediately after separation. 395. denserier: see n. to 207. Lucr.
has only forms of densere, though many edd. read 5, 491 densabant.
So above condenseat, which is the only form of the e·stem of the com·
pound known. 397. trahere: intrans.; ‘to draw' into ‘itself':=

tence. in which commemorando takes the place of a protasis. The
Latin requires the historical tenses of verbs· of ability, propriety,
necessity, and obligation in the apodoses of conditional sentences to
take the indic„ whatever the mode or form of the protasis. In
like manner the present possum is often used in both prose and verse.-
Cf. below 411. In such cases trans. possum ‘I might,’ ‘I could.’
401. conradere: this rare word in its literal meaning ‘to serape
together,’ ‘gather together,’ is found 6, 304 and 444. In a figurative
sense it is used only here: and in his choice of this term perhaps the
poet wished to imply the difficulty of the act. 402. sagaci= see n.
to 130. 403. tute: emphatic from position as well as in form.
404-5. ut canes persaepe naribus inveniunt quietes (‘ lair’) montivagae
ferai etc. The simile carries out the suggestion in sagaci: intectas con-
cessive, ‘though covered.' Cf. Cic. De Sen. 11, 37 Appius regebatet
caecus et senex, ‘ though both blind and old-⁹ 406. institerunt: the
