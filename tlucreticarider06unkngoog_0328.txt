OF MATTER. 635-920.

1. Matter is not made up of the different forms
and states of a single element,—of tire, or air, or
water, or earth. 635—711.

T he doctrine of Heraclitus and his followers tlzat fire is the primal
substrate is unsound (63 5-644), because it sails to account for tlte diver·
sity of existing things (64 5-6 54) 3 and because it deniesrthe existence of
void —- a position inconsistent with their theory of rarefaction and con-
densation (65 5-671). lee truth is to be found only in tlte doctrine of the

atom (672-689).

637. videntur: ‘are seen! The poet has now laid down the fun-
damental doctrines of his system. Before applying them to the expla-
nation of things, he proceeds to combat briefly and in a masterly way
the wrong views about matter held by other philosophers, particularly
HeraclituS, Empedocles, and Anaxagoras. 638. Herae. ε Hera-
clitus οἱ Ephesus (lived about 500 Bc.) taught that there is a single
primitive essenee, fire, from which all things are derived. But to him
fire was something more than the ultimate matter. It was both mat·
ter and force, rational force. It was also the symbol of change: for
opposed to the Eleatic idea of a changeless world he held that there
is nowhere, never, rest or pause; that all things are ever in state of
transition between opposite states. This fire, he held, goes over into
all the various forms that we find in the universe by qualitative change,
as the result of which appear rarefaction and condensation. From
an impulse of its own nature as rational force, fire in part became
transmutecl into moisture, moisture then into earth¹ Thus by trans
