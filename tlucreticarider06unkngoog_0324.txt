· the simplest constr. seems to be ‘⁸ to suppose the clause a double one,”

quod longa diei aetas, [hoc est] infinita aetas anteacti temporis etc. For
the scanning diii see n. to 5, 1023 for that of anteacta see n. to 233.
559. quod: for antecedent supply id as subj. of posset. —fregissetz
frangere means ‘to break up ' a thing, usually a whole, by destroying
its structure 3 disturbare, ‘to demolish ' by rending the parts violently
asunder3 dis-soluere, ‘to destroy utterly' by reducing a thing to its
primal elements. leaving not the least vestige or trace of its form or
properties. 560. relicuo: scanned rillca‘ae all the forms of this
word in Lucr. are read as four syllables. See n. to 215; and cf. 3,
648 ; 4, 976. 564. aevi: see n. to 549. 565. solidissima ε
ριέἀίεειῐίνες constant=sunt. 566. cum : ⁸ while‚' ‘ although,’ mildly
concessive. In Plautus and Terence generally, sometimes even in
classical prose, cum concessive and cum causal are found with the
indicative; the regular classica} constr. however requires the subjunc-

looked upon as a fact.—possit: Munro's and Sauppe's emend. for

TranS. tamen (ratio) possit reddi quo pacto omnia, quae fiunt mollia, ( ut)

thought to be not merely a property of combinations of atoms but
itself a form of matter. Cf. 2, 153 corpuscula quaeque vaporis, 2, 843
etc. 571. silices= wrongly taken by some to mean ‘cliffs' or
masses in rock in general ; rather, literally, ⁸ flint stone3‚’ as the type
of all that is hardest in rock formation. Munro thinks there is a
reference to the hard blocks of basalt with which the· Romans paved
their streets and roadS. With this technical sense silim is sometimes
found in inscriptions, as well as in Livy, and occasionally elsewhere.
572. poterit: on the mood and tense of the apodosis see A. 307, b.
Rem. and foot-n.; H. 511, 1, n. 1. Cf. 3, 931-950 si vocem rerum
natura repente mittat . . . quid respondemus? The indic. is generally
used by Lucr. in conditional clauses with possum ; cf. 656 below.
575. condenso: stronger than denso' from the force of the con-. Comi
is common in Lucr., and is sometimes met with in other poets, but is
rare in prose. magis here goes with cond. 576. In illustration of
lines 565-573 Munro quotes a remarkable passage from Newton:
“All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles: for otherwise
