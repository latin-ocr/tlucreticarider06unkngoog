remain if the mind, like the body, did not come from fixed seed ,- sor if
souls passed from one body to another dogs might have the spirit of stags,
hawks qf doves, men might be brutish, and brutes wisc. Grant that the
soul goes from one body only into another‘ os the same kind, the child ought
to be wise with mature mind, the colt as well trained as the horse. Men
may say that in a tender body the mind becomes weak ; then since it has
been so changed it must be mortal. 741-768.

741. triste . . . seminium : ‘sullen race ' or ‘breed.' 743. a pa-
tribus datur et patrius pavor incitat artus is rejected as a “ manifest

747 et seq. According to the view of Lucr., there is no qualitative or
essential difference between the mind and soul of animals and the
mind and soul of man. This, in fact, is a common tenet of believers
in metempsychosis, materialists of all ageS, and of evolutionists with
materialistic tendencieS. It waS, perhaps», mo'st fully unfolded by the
French rationalists of the latter part of the last century; but Haeckel
and those who share his form of the Doctrine of Descent insist upon
it quite as strenuously as they. “ If, as is usually done, we divide the
different emotions of the soul into three principal groupS‚— sensa·
tion, will, and thought,-—we shall find in regard to every one of them
that the most highly developed birds and mammals are on a level
with the lowest human beingS, or even decidedly surpass them.”
Haeckel, ‘ Nat. Hist. of Creation,' ii. 3643 cf. the -rest of the chapter.
The proof, however, is as conspicuously lacking as in the time of
Lucr. Consult Bowen, ‘ Gleanings from a Literary Life: pp. 328-3503

wild animals; cf. Mela, 3, 53 Verg. Aen. 4, 347. For the dogs Munro
