Ι οἱ antiquity. Diog. Laert (10, 26) says he left three hundred vol-
umeS, in which ‘ there was not a citation from other sources ; but the

books were entirely filled with Epicurus’ own sentiments! 'l'he style
is said to have been exceedingly careleSS, bald, harsh, and full of repe-
titions. There are extant only four letterS, the Maxims, and some
fragments. 12. aurea dieta: the Pythagoreans had golden
verses (χρυσᾶ ἔπη) attributed to their founder3 from them, perhapS,
the expression here was horrowed. 14. vociferari: see n. to 1,

of 14-17 cf. 2, 1-13 and n. to 1, 112 tgnoratur. Democritus taught
that the cause of fault is the ignorance of what is better (Frag. 116
x ἅμαρτίης αἰτίη ἦ ἀμαθίῃ τοῦ κρὲσσονος); Epicurus held, however,
that happiness is not “directly promoted by knowledge, but only indi-
rectly, in as far as knowledge min-isters to practica] needs, or clears
{away hindrances to their attainment.” 16. moenia mundi: see

18. divum: see n. to 1, 1.—sedesq. quietae: Epicurus pictured
the gods as dwelling in the spaces of the universe between the worlds,
ever blessed and unvexed by any pain or trouble, never interfering
with the course of nature, and utterly regardless of mankind. Ten·
nyson well brings out the spirit of this passage, ⁸ Lucretius’ : —

“ The Gods, who haunt
The lucid interspace of world and world,
Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,
Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder means,
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
Tbeir sacred, everlasting calm 1⁹⁹
