11. LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER.

i. PmLosopmr AMONG Tm: ROMANs m Lucam-108⁹ Tum.

THE genius of the Romans was adapted to practical rather
than· artistic construction. They wrought out the greatest re·
sults and made the most valuable contributions to humanity in
the domain of politics and law.⁸ For the art5‚ literature, and
philosophy, for all that has to do with the culture of life as dis-
tinguished from its bare necessities‚ they were indebted to the
Greeks. The Greek masterpieces and verse-forms furnished
them models for literary composition. Greek artists and sculp-
tors painted and carved for them. Greek teachers gave them
instruction in music and the liberal arts. Finally, the imitation
of the Greeks in many of the ways of common life became the
fashion. In the contact of the two diverse forms of civilization‚
the one characterized by power of military and civil organization‚
the other by the pre-eminent influence of the individual mind
and the development of taste‚ that founded upon force prevailed
over the other only to be shaped by it. ‘Greece, conquered‚
took captive her rude conqueror, and brought the arts to rustic
Latium.' ¹

When the Romans first began to have leisure and a taste for
speculation, the Greek systems had already reached their fullest
expansion. The rapid extension of Roman territory under the
old Republican form of government was then placing before
young men new political. prizes to be won by personal power.
