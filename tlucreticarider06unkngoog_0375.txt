be distinguished from the body; that it is born with it; that it grows
up with it; that it is modified in the same progression; in short
everything ought to make man conclude that it perishes with it. The
soul, as well as the body, passes through a state of weakness and in·
fancy3 . . . arrived with the body at its full powers, having in conjunc·
tion with it reached maturity, it does not cease for a single instant to
partake in common of its sensations, whether these are agreeable or
disagreeable3 . . . in an old man . . . alas! it sinks down with the
body.'’ As representing the view of modern materialistic evolution
consult Haeckel‚ ⁴ Nat. Hist. of Creation,’ ii. 361-2: ‘⁴ With regard to
the origin of the human mind or the soul of man, we, in the first
place, perceive that in every human individual it develops from the
beginning, step by step and gradually, just like the body‚” etc., etc.

The following arguments (3-7) are based upon the
relation os soul and body and the analogy be·
tween them:

(3) As the body ar racked with disease so is th} mind with cares, grief,
sear ; like the former, then, the latter must partake os death. 4 59-462.

(4) In sickness of the body the mind oflen raves and goes into stupor ;
that which can be thus afflcted by disease must finally peris-h. 463—47 5.

(5) Drunkenness unsettles the mind ; whatever can be unsettled‚ by a
more violent cause may be destroyed. 476-486,

(6) ln a fit the power of the mind is fhr a time lost ; then, at the death
qs the body it must be lost utterly and sorever. 487·- 509.

(7) The mind like the body may be cured by medicine ,⁰ now curing
involves the adding· or taking away or changing about of parts ,· whatever
allows a shifting of parts is mortal. 510-52 5.
