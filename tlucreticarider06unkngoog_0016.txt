xii , INTRODUCTION

But while Lucretius had no biographer and did not, like
Horace and ovid, tell his life out in his verse, his personality is
by no means obscure. No poem, ancient or modern, shows
more clearly than the De Rerum Natura the impress of a marked
individuality. Some poets voice a general feeling, or paint a
pleasing fancy, or describe an experienee, in such a way one
cannot tell whether they are giving an insight into their own
hearts and lives or not. But not so Lucretius. In the course
of his reasoning he speaks in the first person, often with direct
address bids Memmius heed what he is saying.1 His diction is
characterized by a vehemence and straightforwardness of state—
ment that can have their source only in sincerity and firm eon-

viction. He never trifleS. Whether heis reasoning about the
atom, or explaining natural phenomena, or hurling fieree invec-

tives against the blind thraldom of men under superstition, he is
always terribly in earnest. Between the lines of the poem we
read the man.

In Lucretius the fire and graphic power of the poet were
aptly blended with the calm logie and constructive ability of the
philosopher. With the poet's eye he looked out upon the world,
and scanned the life of men3 with philosophie sweep of thought
he marshalled in array all the facts that he had gained, and tried
to track out causeS, to know the origin and modes of being, to
fathom the mystery of the universe.2 Few of the ancients lived
in so close sympathy with nature as he 3 ⁸ yet he loved not
nature for her own sake. He had what Tyndall ealls the
“ seientific imagination.’'⁴ The perception of beauties of land-
scape or of the sea and the discovery of natural processes unno-
ticed by the common throng awoke indeed a responsive chord 3
but all these forthwith were made to serve in the illustrating or
enforcing of some truth, took their place in his philosophie sys-
tem. In the presence of the problem of the universe he had
