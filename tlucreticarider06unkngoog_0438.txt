376 LUCRETIUS [v. 1107·-

undistinguished, will be listenerS, who usually do no more than ex-
press from time to time assent or dissent.” Spencer goes on to show
how in each group usually there would be some one superior to all
the rest, who would have “ more than an individual share ” of influ-
ence. Such would correspond perhaps to Lucretius’ reges. 1110.
N otice that Lucr. conceives of property as at first held in common;
and that the forni he mentions first is stock. Did he assume a pas-
toral state intermediate between the agricultural and utter savagery ?
The Romans themselves recognized the derivation of pecunia from
pecus ‚· cf. Varro L. L. 5, 95 pecus, a quo pecunia universa, quod in pe-
core pecunia tum consistebat pastoribus. 1111. facie= cf. 11 14' pul-
chris ; 1116 pulchro corpora refers to the entire appearance of a man.
Modern writers on the development of civilization attribute great im-
portance to‘physical prowess and superior ability, but less to mere
appearance than our poet. Darwin, however, discusses fully the bear·
ing of beauty on the progress of the race through its influencing the
selection of partners in marriage: see ‘Descent of Man,' ii. 326-338.

ι 1113. res: ‘ wealth.' The ancient poets often inveighed against gold

as the “ root of all evil.'' Cf. Ov. Met. 1, 135 et seq. .· -

also Verg. Aen. 3, 5 5 quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra firmes.
1117 et seq. Ethical reflections like these, interspersed throughout
the poem, testify to the poet’s earnestness of purpose. With 1117-9
cf. 2, 20—333 EpicuruS‚ Diog. Laert. 10, 130 ‘And we think content-
ment a great good, not that we may altogether put up with a little,
but that if we have not much we may use the little, being fully per-
suaded that those most enjoy abundance who would the least feel the
lack of it; and that while everything that is natural is easy to get,
whatever is useless is hard to procure,’ etc.; cf. also Id. 10, 144 and
146. Contentrnent with a little was a favorite theme of Horace; the
wise man, the Epicurean said, could live happily on bread and water.
The luxurious tendencies of later Epicureans arose from emphasizing
the doctrine of pleasure inculcated by their master above that of sels-
control and rational enjoyment. 1119. penuria parvi: a little
