times found as gen. 107.¹ Horace also invokes 'the goddess of
Fortune, who, to both him and our poet, seems to have been merely
a personification of the natural order of things, “at the same time
chance ·and inexorable necessity.’'

Seven reasons are given why the world must
inevitably perish:

1. No divine power presided over its formation, or can stay its
destruction. 1 10-234.

(1) The world and its parts are not themselves divine, can contain
no animating and conserving soul ,· sor mind cannot exist apart
from its particular place in a living, suitable body. 1 10-145.

κιο. Cf. 6, 979-980. The whole passage, 110-234‚ seems out of
place, and is hence bracketed3 it does not fit in well with the context,

Ep. and Scep.' ch. β, Β and c. In controverting the philosophy of
the Stoics Lucr. never does them the honor to call them by name.
