stands by Bac. flos here the flavor or bouquet of the wine, doubtless
the correct interpretation, to judge from the context and 2, 848 nardi

florem. 227. rerum: i.e., the wine‚⁹the persume, and the body
from which moisture has escaped. 229. scire licett see n. to 1,

4. The mind and soul are complex; and by the differ-

ent proportion and mixture of the four parts ’

different characters are produced. 231-322.

T he mind is composed os wind, heat, air, and a subtle nameless fourth
clement, in which arise the beginnings os sensation, and qs which the least

231. Cf. the doctrine of Epicurus in Plut„ De Plac. Phil. 4, 3 that
the soul is κρᾶμα ἐκ τεσσάρων, ἐκ ποιοῦ πυρώδους, ἐκ ποιοῦ ἀερώδους, ἐκ

Eng. trans. of Zeller the three elements are wrongly given as “fire,
air, vapour ” (‘ Stoics, Ep., and Scep! new edit. p. 454). 232. ten-

borne in mind that each one of these elements is regarded as a
combination of atoms, so that the soul itself is a combination of com-
binations of atoms. 234. quisquam: see n. to 1, 1077. —cui:
the use of the dat. with misceri and se miscere is poetic. See Kiihner,
