him 3 1 and he wrote in verse simply to make his doctrine more
palatable to those whom it was intended to deliver.‘-' Here then
is a character of singular moral strength, that for the good of
men set before himself the great task of revealing the truth,—
‘the way of life.’ ⁸

N evertbeless Lucretius was not one that moved much among
men in their dail'y walkS. He does not speak of the Forum,
the busy streetS‚ the centres of interest in the life and society
of Rome, so often referred to by the Latin-poetS. He knew
well the pleasures of contemplation. When he speaks of the
struggle for office, the ambitions and passions of the mass of
mankind,⁴ it is in the manner of one who views these things
from a distance, who in a life of retirement grieves at the folly

stern censure of contentions about position we may trace a re-
action against the ferment and turmoil in political life that he
must have witnessed in the years just preceding his death.12
He finds the only hope of peace and abiding joy in ‘philosophy,
guide of life!
