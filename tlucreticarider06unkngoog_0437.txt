4. The Discovery of Fire. 1091-1104.

Fire was discovered either by the lightning striking and grafting, or ι

by the rubbing· together qs the boughs qs trees till flame was produced ;
tlte use qs it in preparing sood men learned from the sun, which cooks

1092 et seq. Lachmann has well shown that 1091-1160 are out of
connection with what precedes and follows; that they are probably
an addition by the poet after the rest of the poem was finished. He
speaks here of the origin of fire, though its use was referred to in

function of leadership in primitive society cf. Spencer, ‘Pi-in. of
Sociology‚’ ii. 311 ε In “ an unorganized horde . . . the assembled indi-
viduals will fall, more or less clearly, into two divisions. The elder,
the stronger, and those whose sagacity and courage have been proved
by experience, will form the smaller part, who carry on the discus-
