can be found.1 The processes of generalization from the pro-
ducts of sense-perception and the formation of judgments the·
poet does'not touch upon. Thus in common with his school, he
assumed immediate knowledge of thingS, and found the only

source of knowledge in experience.

2. Lucretius’ Theory of the· Universe.

There are two elemental parts of the universe, matter and
void. All things are made up ol these. Void is everywhere
where matter is not; matter and void are mutually exclusive.²
Matter is composed of atomS. These are perfectly solid, with-
out beginning or end or any possibility ol change in nature,
minute beyond the limit of vision, and known only by the mind.⁸
The atoms differ in form3 they are rough, smooth‚ hooked‚
round, larger, smaller; but the various shapes are limited in
number, though there is an infinite number of atoms of each
shape. They differ also in weight‚ The movement of atoms is
immeasurably swift‚ and always downward, because of their
gravity, unless impeded. Everything that exists contains void
as well as atomS‚ since only these are devoid of empty space.4
Color, heat, cold, moisture, dryness, all the properties that can be
detected in things, are accidents of the combinations of atoms; the
atoms themselves have no properties save extension, hardneSS,
weight‚ and motion. All combinations are unstable‚ continually
changing. Dissolution awaits everything.⁶

The universe is without limit in any of its dimensionS, and
has no centre. There is no end to space, and atoms are num-
berless. There is an infinite number of worlds.⁶ As the atoms
sall in infinite space, some by their own power swerve to one
side.⁷ These become involved with otherS, forming a whirling
