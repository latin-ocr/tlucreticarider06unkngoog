224 LUCRETws ² [Γ. 26-

notwithstanding Lucullus’ popularity, the triumph was obtained only
with the greatest difficulty. As praetor in 58 Memmius showed the
same spirit and courage, which, however, were devoted to purely par-
tisan and selfish ends„ Though he bitterly attacked Julius Caesar at
this time, later seeing it would be to his advantage to join Caesar's
party he shamelessly went over to it, and accepted the aid of his
former enemy in presenting himself as candidate for the consulship
in 54. He soon proved faithless to Caesar, and being impeached
for election bribery he left Rome in disgrace, and went to live at Mity-
lene. This happened after Lucretius’ death. Memmius had some
power as an orator3 but Cicero says of him that his adherence to
Greek models and his dislike of hard work interfered with his success
in this direction. He dabbled in verses of questionable propriety, and
his life was grossly immoral. Probably it was the dash and audacity
of his public career that attracted the admiration and drew the sym-
pathy of the quiet poet-philosopher, whose earnest patriotism per·
haps imagined in him a great reformet. It does not seem that he had
any special liking for Epicurean views; indeed, the opposite might be
inferred from one of Cicero’s letters (Ad Fam. 13, 1). Nor was he
famous as a patron of literature. But from what we know of his

character and life, we may suppose that he was one who would gladly
welcome the doctrine of eternal death, and a world without a deity.

with nouns like tempus the distributive sense of ‘omnis’ applies to
parts instead of units. Here the meaning is ‘at every moment’ or
‘ point’ ‘of time,’ i. e. ⁴ alwayS,’ ‘ ever.’ The phrase should be taken in
close connection with ornatum.

29. moenera: old spelling for munera. By the use of occasional
archaisms Lucr. gives his style an antique aroma. —militiai ε the gen.
of the first' decl. in Lucr. has very often the old ending ai, which is
scanned as a spondee. A. 36, a‚· G. 27, Rem. ις H. 49, 23 Roby,
356, (c). 31 et seq. This contrast between Love and War as pow-
ers shaping the world’s destiny suggests the antithesis between Love
and Strife (Φιλία or Φιλότης and Νεῖκος) that runs through the philoso-
phy ot' Empedocles. 32. Mavors: old and fuller form of Mars,
found also occasionally in the later poets. 34. vulnere amoris:
vulnus amoris became later a stock phrase in Roman literature. Its
origin is to b'e traced in the conception of Cupid (Eros) by the later
