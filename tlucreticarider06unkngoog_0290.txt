5, 1161-1245 and nn.; 2, 54 etc. Burton’s discussion of religious mel—
ancholy, ‘Anat. of Melan. ’ Part 3, sec. 4, contains many quaint and
suggestive observations on the fears inspired by religion or the lack of
it. 62. ante oculos: a forcible expression in emphatic position3
tr. ‘in plain sight.’ - 65. super: adv„ as in 39, ‘ overhead,' ‘above.’
The poet seems to have seen in imagination some vast lowering pres-
ence like the cloud-forms so graphically described in 4, 129—142.
66. Graius homo: Epicurus. For his philosophy see Introd.; on the
extravagant praise bestowed on him by his followerS, see n. on 3, 3
te. — mortalis: with oculos. -— contra: adv„ in sense = contra illam.
In Lucr. contra, ante, post, super, supera (supra), and subter are oftener
adverbs than prepositions. Circum, extra, inter, praeter, propter are
also frequently adverbs. Holtze, ‘Syntaxis Lucretianae Lineamenta‚’
cap. 4, gives abundant illustrations of the different uses. 68. fama:
Bentley, whom Lachmann follow8, reads fana. instead of fama ; be-
cause, as Lachmann says, scilzket fam a non omnis necessario m agn a
est. Fama not only has the authority of the MSS„ but also gives
better sense3 for it was not so much the existence of gods or
shrines of the gods as the unfounded story of them, that inspired
sear.

70. inritat: inritat for inn'tavit‚· so 6, 587 disturbat for disturbavit.
See Roby, ‘ Gr.’ 662. The contracted perfect in the third pers·
sing. and first pers. pl. of the indic. is rare; for examples see Neue,
‘ Formenlehre,’ 2d edit. ii. 534. Cases like inritat must be carefully
distinguished from versat (Enn. Ann. quae . . . versat in pectore fixa,
Cic. De Sen. 1, 1 ; Vahlen’s Enn. 340) and the like, where the original
d of· conj. 1 is retained in the present tense. Instances of the latter
use are not uncommon in PlautuS, and are occasionally met with in
the poets of the Augustan Age. See Corssen, ‘Aussprache,’ 2d edit.
ii. 488; also Neue, ut sup. ii. 433-4. 72. viv. vis an. : a striking
expression, especially for one who considered mind and soul only a
form of matter. 73. processit: supply ille, referring to Epicu·

, rus; so peragravit below. - moenia mundi: the fire-belt, or aether,

that many of the ancients thought formed the outer enveloping por-
tion os the world. Epicurus did not assign to this definitely the
nature of fire; in his letter to Pythocles (Diog. Laert. 10, 25, 88) he
says that the world is a kind of extent girt by the heaven, embracing
both stars and earth and all things visible ς that it is separated from
the infinite, and is confined within a limit‚ in texture either rare or
