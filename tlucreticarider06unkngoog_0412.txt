6, 592 and Ov. Met 2, 304 “begins the description oi Jupiter striking
a man with lightning ; ’⁹ in Aen. 7, 770 and Ov. Met. 1, 154 tum pater
omnipotens is used in a similar manner. 400. magnanimum:
Ovid applies this epithet to Phaethon, Met. 2, 111. His prolix but
spirited account of Phaethon (Met. 2, 1-400) in several places shows
the influence of the present passage. Ovid was one of the few promi-
nent literary men of his time that admired LucretiuS, and were not
ashamed or afraid to own it. Cf. Amorum 1, 15, 23-4 ε --

Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti
Exitio terras cum dabit una dies.

buila- but from infinite time atoms os every kind clashing· tried all forms
of unz'cm till earth, sea, sky, and living things resulted. 416—431.

416 et seq. The poet h'as proved that the world must perish, and
also that it had a beginning ; he now proceeds to show of what sort
that beginning was; how, from a cloud of falling atoms clashing in
space, the present order of things has come about and continues in
existence. 416. materiai: see n. to 1, 55 primordia. By the
coniectus materiai the poet means the atoms falling in the void before
the world was3 see 2, 80 et seq. 419-422 = 1, 1021-4‚ where
