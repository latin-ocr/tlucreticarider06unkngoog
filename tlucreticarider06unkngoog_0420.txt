The statement is not true. 583. ut . . . cumque: tmesis3 ‘it
must be seen by us on high from the earth (hinc) precisely such
as it is in the outline which defines it, and of the size it actually is.'
584. quanta quanta. : = quantacumque, an ante-classical usage.
585. hinc: ‘ from the earth‚’ as hinc in 5843 the line should be taken
in close connection with 590-1 ; 586-9, introducing a comparison‚ are
parenthetical. 589. alteram etc.: provided the flickering of a
fire is seen clearly and its heat perceived, the size seems to vary very
little‚— in appearing either larger or smaller, — whether one be near
at hand or far off, in proportion to the distance. The comparison is
copied from Epicurus3 lsee Diog. Laert. 10, 91 ‘ But taken by itself‚ the
sun may be a little larger or a little smaller than it appears, or of the
same size that it seems to be3 for just so it is with fires among uS,
which are seen at a distance and perceived (directly) by the senses.'

(4) The emim'on of so much light and beat from the sun, itsef'f so
small, may be caused by the concurreme offiery particles, or by the burn·
ing of the air around it, or by the existence near it qs a vast unseen fire
( 592-613). ’ The sun goes over in a year the same space of the heavens be-
tween the sagus that the moon traverses in a mouth, because the apeed of
the heavenly bodies is less tlte nearer they are to the earth ,· the moon is
nearer' than tlte sun, tlte sun than tlte stars, which therefore in their swtfi
onward course first pass the moon, and then the swa,- hence the moon
seems to gofaster than the sun. Or perchance currents (ff air may keep
driving the sun and moon from §ummer to winter solstae‘ce and back again.
