to prove the immortality of the soul. Whatever is divisible is per-
ishable; the soul is not divisible, therefore it is imperishable. Cf.
Cic. De Sen. 21, 78 cum simplex animi natura esset neque habe·
ret in. se quicquam admixtum dispar sui atque dissimile, non posse
eum dividi, quod si non posset, non posse interire ‚· also Plat. Phaed.
78-80. 642. falcis. currus: see n. to 5, 1301. 643. de su-
bito: like ‘ of a sudden’ in the colloquial phrase ‘all of a sudden.’
644. videatur: passive.—artubus: the old grammarians preferred
this form of the abl. pl. of artus to distinguish it from artibus (ars).

See n. to 1, 260. Lucr. is fond of the word artus. 647. in stu-
dio dedita: not a common constr. ; cf. 4, 815 quibus est in rebus de-
ditus epse ; dedere is generally accompanied by a dat. 648. reli-

quo: see n. to 1, 560. —petessit: a rare verb; cf. 5, 810. ‘petessere
antiqui pro petere dicebant' (Fest.). 649. tenet: ‘perceives.'—
tegmine: i.e.‚ the shield, which the soldier carried on his left arm.
650. abstraxe: = abstraxisse ; see n. to 1, 233. 651. alius:
supply tenet. 653. digitos: like δάκτυλος, used more often of

fingers than of toes. 657—8. A corrupt and difficult passage3 ¹.

micanti . . . cauda e, Lachmann and Munro for minanti . . . caude,-
Lachmann has serpentem for serpentis, and utrim‘que for utrumque.
Munro thinks a verse is lost after 658, something like et caudam et

molem totius corporis omnem: with this added both sense and con· ,

str. are clear. cauda is abl. abs. with micanti. Without the added

verse utrumque must refer to lingua and cauda. 660. ancisa:
found only here. 662. ipsam se: obj. of petere ,· the mangled
body and tail, as Munro explains. It is a common say'ing that when
a snake is killed the parts quiver till sunset. 664. omnibus:
proleptic; belongs with particulis. 666. animantem: see n. to
573. Notice the assonance‚ of which Lucr. is so fond, in animantem
animas. 667. una: predicative. 668. utrumque: i.e., cor-

pus et anima ; trans. ‘ both.’

(17) Is the soul were immortal, memory ought to reach far back into ”

the past before our birth. Is} in being joined to the body, it sufflred so
great change as to blot out recollection, that surely was not sar from de-

struction ; the soul which then was must have perished, that which now
is, have been created anew. 670-678.

670 et seq. This argument rests upon the assumption that the soul
to be immortal must have existed from eternity, —the doctrine of pre-
