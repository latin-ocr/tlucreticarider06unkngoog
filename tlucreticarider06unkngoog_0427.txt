771 et seq. The poet, having described the evolution of the world
and explained the phenomena of the heavenS, now comes to the
origin of life. In this passage, which is introductory to the rest of the
book, he makes no mention of the development of man in civilization
and the origin of superstition, topics that take up the remainder of

the book after 924. 772. quicquid: see n to 3, 787. 777.
neque opinantis: = nec opinantis,· see n. to 3, 959. 778. coni·
vent: used of an eclipse only here. 781. arva: properly so

called, because the earth's surface had not become hardened by time,
and had not been covered with vegetation. — in lum. oras: this phrase
twice occurs in the fragments of Ennius (118 and 165, Vahlen), from
whom perhaps Lucr. took it. See n. to 1, 22. 782. crerint: in
the sense of decreverint, ‘ concluded,' ⁸ resolved.’

First the earth putfhrtlz herb-5 ond trees; then birds and animals were
produced ,· and last of all, from cavitz‘es near its surface infants crept,
to whom with balmy air the new earth gave milk and warmtlz and
downy beds of grass (783—820). Raessghtly, then, is earth named mother,
since from herself she brought forth all life. But now, wearied wzth age,
she has ceased to bear ,· for the earth, like all things else, is changing, and
grows old (821-836).

788-9. pluma etc.: pluma of course corresponds to pennipotentum,
pili and saetae to quadrespedum ,· for the arrangement cf. Lowell‚ ‘ Sir

Launsel ’ :—

Whether we look, or whether we listen‚
We hear life murmur, or see it glisten.

791. inde loci: see n. to 443.—mort. saecla: same as animalia
below. 792. multa modis multis: see n. to 1, 341. 793.
neque etc.: so Epicurus expre'ssly states», Diog. Laert. 10, 74: ⁸ We
are not to suppose that animals are derived from the infinite; for no
one can explain how the germs from which animals and plants and
the other things that we see are produced, could be brought from
outside into a world like this, nor why such a world as this would
not be able to create them in and of itself. Thus also in it they
would be nourished; in this light, especially, we are to think of the
earth! All this is to refute the common notion that life is kindled
from the sky (cf. n. to 1, 2 50), and the philosophie doctrine professed
