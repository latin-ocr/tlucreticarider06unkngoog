5ο. quod superest: a common expression in Lucr., indicating the
completion of a topic and introducing a final statement. It is equiva-
lent to an adverbia} acc.; lit. ‘ as to what remains ’ ; tr. ‘for the rest!
51. veram rationem: i.e. the Epicurean philosophy. It was not alone
the ancient materialists that thought they had found the true reason ς
Haeckel speaks of the “unassailable truth ’' of the Theory of De-
scent. See the ‘ Natural Hist. of Creation,' trans„ ii. 334. 52. dis·
posta: cf. reposta above3 dtchdsi‘td could not stand in hexameter verse.

54. ratione: ratio in Lucr. has many different meanings. The most '

important are (Εἷς-ετξ ‘ sy‘ste-mss as here ; ⁴ [2233.an as in 51 3 ‘ vLayss as
in aliqua ratione and the like. 55. primordia: ‘the first-begin-
ningS,' i.e. the atoms, the primal or ultimate elements of things. Lucr.
does not use the word atomi (Gk. εί-τομος, ‘ that which cannot be cut ⁹),
which was introduced into Latin by Cicer03 see Plut. Cic. 40 ; Cic. De

Fin. 1, 6. Primordia (once written ordia prima, 4, 28) is the favorite

÷ term of the poet ; but as pm'mbrdi‘brum, primbrdi‘is cannot be used in
² hexameter werse, in the gen„ dat., and abl. he substitutes principto’mm

·' and principiis. It corresponds to αἱ ἀρχαί of EpicuruS. As synonyms

Ἃ*

Lucr. has genitalia corpora ‘ begetting bodieS,’ corpora prima ‘ first
bodieS,’ semina rerum ‘ seeds of thingS,' and cunctarum exordia rerum
‘the beginnings of all thingS,’ because all things are made up of atoms;
also materiem and corpora materiai, because he conceived of matter
only as composed of atoms. He uses the sing. princzpium in charac-
terizing the physical systems of other philosophers, as 1, 707 ; primor-
dium is not found in Lucr. Cf. n. on 1, 52 5 plenum. 56. unde τ =
e quibus. Unde is often. used this way, of persons as well as things,
ih both prose and verse ; so in Gk. ὅθεν and ὅθενπερ. - omnis: goes
with res. —natura creet etc. ε with the personification of nature here
cf. Biichner, ⁸ F orce and Matter,’ trans„ p. 88: “ Nature, the all·
engendering and all-devouring, is its own beginning and end, birth
and death; she produced man by her own power. and takes him again.”
