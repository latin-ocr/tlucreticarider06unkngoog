Cic. N. D. 1, 8, 2ο quae est enim coagmentatio non dissolubilis ? aut quId
est, cuius principium aliquod sit, nihil est extremum ,9 The argument
of this paragraph is precisely the same as that of Epicurus, who “says
that the worlds are perishable because their parts undergo change ’⁹

· (μεταβαλλόντων τῶν μερῶν) ; see Diog. Laert. 10, 74.

(1) Earth is mortal ,·· some of it, parched by the sun and trodden by
the feet, is scattered by the wind ; some is worn away by streams.
It is the mother and at the same time the common tomb of all
things. 247-260.

(2) Water, too, is perishable ; the sea, streams, and springs are always
over-flowing ‘totth nevo supplies, while the sum is ever the same5
for wind and sun take away a part, and a part through the
earth finds its way back to the sources of rivers. 261-27 2.

(3) The air, likewise, is hourly changing,· for into it goes whatever
passes off‘ftom things, and unless it gave back matter to things
they would all be turned into air. 27 3—280.

(4) A nd fire also ‚· for the sun is always sending forth new light, and
that which flows from it perishes. as when a cloud comes between
it and us the light below disappears ,· so lamps are constantly sup-
plying the place (ff old light with new ,· the same must be thought
true of the heavenly bodae'es. 281-30 5.
