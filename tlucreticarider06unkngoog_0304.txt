nourish it. The effects of different kinds of food are discussed 4, 633
et seq.

(4) There would be no need of rainfor plants norfhodfor animals.
192-198.

19⁴2. certis imbribus: ‘fixed seasons of rain! 193. submit-
tere ι ‘put forth ’; a favorite word of our poet in this connection. Cf.
1, 8. 194. secreta cibo: secernere is often followed by the abl. with

a, ab ‚⁰ sometimes by the abl. with ex ‚· rarely and only in poetry by the
simple abl. as here and in Hor. Od. 1, 1, 32 secernunt populo. Lucr.
has the gen. of separation in 2, 843 secreta teporis etc. For the thought
cf. 1, 1038. 197. ut . . . videmus: i.e. ut multis verbis multa ele
menta communia esse videmus. See n. to 823-6. 198. principiis:
for primordiis ; see n. to 55.

(5) There would be no fixed size for things: men would be εἰσῇτε.
199—207.

199. denique ε ‘ again? This word is used by Lucr. for the most
part not to introduce the last argument of a series, or a generaHzafion,
but simply to present a new point. This use is more akin to the origi-
nal force of denique, which at first referred merely to succession in
time; the meaning ‘finally' is more common in prose, and is not
unknown to our poet; see e. g. ι, 17. 200. qui =-ut erl—per
vada: the implicationis that the deep sea would be to them but a
ford. The poet had in mind some monster like PolyphemuS, so
graphically described by Vergil as wading out into the middle of the
sea, ‘ and yet the billows did not touch bis lofty sides-⁹ See Aen. 3,
664-5. ’ 201. manibus, etc.: like the giants who of old in the war
with the gods were said to have piled Ossa on Pelion in the attempt to
scale Olympus. 202. saecla: i. e. saecla hominum, in the sense of
‘generations’ 204. gignundis: see n. on 59 reddunda. 206. quo:
see n. on 169 seminibus.-— quaeque: supply res. 207. proferrier:
archaic for prqferri. The longer form is frequently met with in in-
scriptions and in Prae-Augustam poetry, sometimes even in the later
poets.
