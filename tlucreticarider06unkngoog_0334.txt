the present universe. Opinions as to the value of Empedocles' sys.
tem were in antiquity very diverse; and so they remain to-day, From
him Lucr. received many suggestionS‚ even taking his poem Περὶ
Φύσεως as a model (see n. to 25). To the likeness oi his views to

But Plato, Aristotle, and especially the Neo-PlatonistS, held EmpA'n ¹
much less esteem. From the evidence collected by Zeller (⁸ Prae-Soc.
Phil.' vol. ii.) the significance of his speculations seems to lie in three
things: (ι) He was the first to introduce into philosophy the concep- .
tion of a moving cause independent of matter, —in this foreshadowing ἶ, ξ

B'rought into natural science the conception of primitive elements (as '1
opposed to a single form of matter). He fixed the number at four, a
number which, after his time, was generally accepted in antiquity‚ and “ s ⁴

a correct theor'y. Thus he became, along with Leucippus, “the founder
of the mechanical explanation of the universe.’' (3) In explaining
the development of animal life he taught a crude form of evolution.

from its peculiar shape by Greeks and Latins alike.

718. aeq. Ion.: Several of the earlier Greek writers use the term
Ionian Gulf (Ἰόνιος κόλπος) as synonymous with Adriatic. The later
geographers considered the Ionian Sea as extending along the south
coast of Italy, including the entrance of the Adriatic, and reaching on
the one hand as far as Greece‚ on the other to Sicily. The Latin writ-
ers, generally, use the term in this latter sense. See Smith, ‘ Dict. of
Geog.' art. Ionium Mare. 719. glaucis: Greek γλαυκός. The

the small craft and poor art of ancient sailors this whirlpool seems
to have furnished just grounds of alarm. The Homeric poems indi-
cate a most exaggerated conception of its perils; and it continued a
