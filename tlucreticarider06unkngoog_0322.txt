particularly stallo, ‘ Concepts and Theories of Modern Physics‚’ ch. 4.
Homogeneity of matter, it is worth while to remark, is not a neces-
sary postulate oi materialistic evolution. See Elam, ‘ Winds of Doc-
trine,’ p. 35. 484. concilio: a technical term in Lucr. for the
‘union' or ‘combination ’ of atoms‚ The subJeet of atoms is more
fully discussed 2, 80-5803 that of the combination of atoms‚ 2, 581-
¹¹74· 486. stinguere :=exting·uere. The simple verb is rarely
used except by Lucr., perhaps not by any other writer except Cicero
in the Aratea. 487. etsi: as in 120, where see n. 491. vapore:
‘ heat ‘3 the word in classical Latin never corresponds to our ‘vapor.'
495. utrumque: i.e. calorem frag-usque. 501. semina etc.= see n.
on 5 5 primordia.

Mauer and void have nothing in common ; where one is, the other is
not ; in atoms there is no void. 503-527.

506. sibi: added for emphasis. Munro compares the English ex-
pression ‘in and for itself.’—puram: ‘unmixed’ 508. ea: ed is
often explained as an abl. with parte or some such word understood.
While such was doubtless the original use, in cases like this it should
be considered an adv.—qua por. cumq.: tmesis. ’ 511-7. In
things (not atoms) there is void, which could not be unless the bound-
ing first beginnings were solid and impenetrable. 520. vocaret:
old form for vacaret, as the early vocivos, vocuos for vacivus, vacuus.
523. omne quod est: i.e., ‘ the universe.' — constaret ε -- esset:
vacuum and inane are of course adj. 524. alternis: old abl. pl.
used as adv.; common in Lucr. but rare elsewhere ; ‘ in alternate
layers.’ 525. plenum z=rb πληρές ‘ the full,' as distinguished from
vacuum τὸ κενόν ‘ the empty.’ Plenum is a term applied to matter from
ᾖ its extension‚ corpus from its power of resistance. Cf. n. to 55, where
ἱ the words for the ultimate forms of matter are discussed. — naviter:
the original force οἱ this word was ‘diligently ’3 then, as one is wholly
intent upon the business in hand, ‘wholly,' ‘entirely‚' the meaning
here. As subject of extat (= est) supply omne quod est.

2. Atoms are indestructible and eternal. 528-634.

ne atoms‚ being without void, are impenetrable ,· and hence can be
affected neither by blows from without, nor by anything permeating within
( 528- 539). Is it were not thus, long ago all things had been reduced to
nothing ( 540- 5 50).
