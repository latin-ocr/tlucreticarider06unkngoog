the term, whether conceived of as divisible into atoms or as a homo-
geneous mass», has in itself no creative principle. It is, therefore, a
product, and as such must have had a cause, a creator. The very fact
of its divisibility, and the adaptation of the smallest portions to one
another, shown in the law of multiple proportions in chemistry‚ point
to a creative and intelligent cause. The atoms bear “all the charac-
teristics of manufactured articles.'’ See Wainwright¹ ‘ Scientific
SophismS,' chS. 8 and 103 Flint, ‘Anti-Theistic TheorieS,' p. 61;

against the AtheistS,’ Diss. L. pp. 272-2853 Biichmann‚ ‘ Befliigelte
Worte;’ Baxter, ‘ An Enquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul,’
vol. ii.; but especially Stallo‚ ‘Concepts and Theories of Modern
Physics! The fullest discussion is in Cudworth, ‘ Intellectual Sys-
tem of the Universe,' chap. 1 and chap. 5, with Mosheim's able dis-
sertation given in Harrison’s edit. vol. iii. 15ο. divinitus: not

the disregard of the gods found in his system. 151. ita: looks for·

the forms from nilum as suits the metre3 also nec hilum ,· cf. 3, 220
and n. The old editions have nihil and nihilum ,· but Lachmann has
clearly shown (n. to 1, 159) that Lucr. used the contracted form
157. unde: as in 131, where see n. 158. The position of¹Lucr. is
exactly that of Biichner: “ That the world is not governed, as is fre-
quently expressed, but that the changes of matter obey a necessity in
it which admits of no exception, cannot be denied by any person
who is but superficially acquainted with the natural sciences.'’ ‘ Force
and Matter,’ trans. p. 5. No ancient materialist ever surpassed this
in positiveness of assertion 1 — quaeque z ‘severally’; see n. to 129.

The poet proceeds to give six prooss, or more properly appla-ations, of
