Craft or courage or speed of ssight or usefulness to man has pre-
served those animals that remain, All the rest, unable to meet
the conditions of existence, have been swept off by ruthless
destruction.1 In men and brutes alike‚ moreover‚ there is a
fixed law of descent. The offspring repeat the characteristics
of the parents in both body and temper.² Thus among the
living things, as well as in the realm of the inorganic‚ natural
law is supreme.

4. Lucretius’ View of Man.

In man, as in all things else, there is nothing but matter and
void. The human organism comprises three distinct parts, the
body, the soul or life-principle, and the mind. These originate‚
develop‚ decline, and perish together, for the mind and soul are
inseparably united with each other and with the body.⁸ The
mind is situated in the mid-region of the breast, while the soul
is distributed throughout the form3 but the mind and soul are
so closely connected that they may be considered as one nature.
They are composed of the finest round atomS,—not of simple
elements‚ however, but of four separate combinatione of atoms
mingled together, wind, heat, air, and a subtle, nameless some-
thing that makes the fourth.4 Volitional impulse arises in this
last element, which imparts motion to the beat-portiom that in
turn to the wind, the wind to the air-essence3 thence move-
mentis aroused in the organism. The mind and soul of man

y differ very little from those of animaIS. Lucretius does not

directly assert that the mind is the noblest part, but this was

clearly his opinion. Once at least he identifies personality
with it.⁶
N otwithstanding his material nature, man is not an automaton.
