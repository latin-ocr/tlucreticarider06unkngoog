infinite number of moving atoms, infinite space and infinite time, a
universe like the present could or would result, belongs properly to
the Calculus of Probabilities. See n. to 823-6; Janet‚ ‘ Final CauseS,
App. x., i.; Burr, ‘ Doctrine of Evoluti0n‚’ Second Serie5,’ sect. 6;
Charpentier, ‘ Me'moire sur la logique du probable.' The position of
Lucr. is essentially that of modern materialistic evolution, whose
‘⁴ claim is that a cloud of atoms, endowed with definite spheres of
attraction and repulsion‚ is able to work out all the results which
seem to us to manifest intelligence and purpose.” See Bowne, ⁸ Re-
view of Herbert Spencer,’ p. 2343 cf. pp. 19-22. Spencer declares
that ‘⁴ this transformation of an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity into
a definite, coherent heterogeneity‚ which goes on everywhere until it
brings about a reverse transformation, is consequent upon certain
simple laws of force.” Stin more outspoken is Haeckel, ⁸ Nat. Hist.
of Creation,’ ch. 1 (i. 20): “ Whilst, then, we emphatically oppose the

vital or teleological view of animate nature, which presents animal and -
vegetable forms as the productioris of a kind Creator, aeting for a

definite purpose, or of a creative, natural force aeting for a definite ὓ
purpose, we must, on the other hand, decidedly adopt that view of
the universe which is called the mecham'cal or causal- It no longer -
occurs to physicistS, chemistS, mineralogistS, or astronomers to seek ’
to find in the phenomena which continually appear before them in
their scientific domain the action of a creator aeting for a definite pur-
pose. They, universally, and without hesitation, look upon the phe-
nomena which appear in their different departments of study as the
necessary and invariable effects of physica] and chemical forces
which are inherent in matter.” Cf. Biichner, ‘Kraft und Stoff '3
