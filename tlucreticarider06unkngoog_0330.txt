268 LUCRETIUS [1. 644-

·‘ Words of learned length and thundering souud
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.·’

Like Lucr., the author of the ‘Systerne de la Nature ⁹ complains that

“ men ever prefer the marvellous to the simple, what they do not un- ,

derstand to what they can understand.’' The whole passage is quoted
by Lange, ‘ Hist. of Mat.’ ii. 119. Munro thinks that the poet here is
aiming directly at the Stoics under the term stolidi, retorting’“ upon
them their own term of reproach.'’

647. denserier: see n. to 395. 648. rarefleri: Lucr. uses four
compounds of facere not found elsewhere, all admirably adapted to
his subject; 3, 906 cinefactunm 6, 353 confervefacit,· 6, 1005 and 1017
vacefit ,· rar-efacere here and 2, 1143; 3, 4423 6, 233 and 870. 649.
super: ⁶ rnoreover “3 si partes ignis· eandem naturam quam totus {gnis

ι habet, super haberent. 650-1. On the assumption that the heavier

‘a—aq— n*-

elements were made out of fire by condensation, the lighter by rare-
faction, the argument is unanswerable. But it applies to the Stoics,
not to Heraclitus: for he taught that the process of change is trans·
mutation of substance, something entirely different. See n. to 638
above. - 651. disque sup.: tmesis, 653. nedum: ‘much the
less ’3 nedum is properly a final conj„ ‘ while not.’ According to Roby
(ξ 1658) the usage here “arises from the prevention of the occur-
rence of the greater event being rhetorically regarded as the purpose
of the occurrence of the less event.’'-variantia2=var1eta55 found

only here and 3, 3183 probably used because vdri'e'tas would not suit .

the metre. 655. id: perhaps acc. like quod genus ; or it may be
that accedat or the like should be supplied. —faciant : ‘ suppose,’ ‘ as-
sume‚’ a common meaning of facere, especially in philosophical writ-
mgs3 the acc. with infin. usually follows. The unexpressed subject
of fac. of course refers to the philosophers who held that fire was the

· primitive matter. 656. poterunt: see n. on 572 poterit. 657.

nasci: Munro’s emend. for muse and mu of MSS. Lachm. reads
adesse. 659. vera viai: see n. to 86; viai goes with ardua
as well as vera. 660. exempt. re. inl: supplies the place of a
conditional clause. The reasoning is akin to that in 235 et seq
663. aestifer: first found in Cicero's Aratea ιιι (352), whence our
poet likely took it.—uti: ‘in the way that.’ 665. potesse: ear-
lier form of posse, but already archaic in the time of Lucr. 666.
ignis: acc. p1.- stingui: sec n. to 486. 667. id: i.e., credere
