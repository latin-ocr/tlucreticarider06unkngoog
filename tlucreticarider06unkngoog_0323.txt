528. plagisz blows, or impact of atoms, and masseS‚ held a very
important place in the Epicurean philosophy, both in the explanation
of the natural processes of growth and decay aud in the doctrine of

’ sense-perception. 531. See 485 et seq. 532. conlidi: ‘crushed

together‚' ‘crushed in.' 533. bina: ‘into two parts‚' ‘in two ’ς
rarely used as here without a substantive. 534. manabile: found
only here ; = penetrale. 537. tam: for eo, to correspond with quo.

set: the imper. tense might have been expected, as indestructibility
is an essential‚ ever-present quality of matter, ‘ if matter were not,’ etc.
But the plup. is more logical, the implication being, ‘if matter from
infinite past time had not been‚’ etc. In the expression of general
truths. however. the Latin tense-idiom is at variance with the English.
For the thought cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 55 ⁸ It is necessary
that something remain indestructible that-all things may not be re-
duced into non-existence! 543. supra z 150 (where see n.) et seq.
546 quo ε =in quae. 548. solida . . . simpl.: ‘solid singlenes8‚’ a
phrase often used by Lucu, by which he forcibly suggests not simply
the impenetrability, but also the individuality, as it were, the dis-
tinct separate existence of the atoms. 549. aevom: ‘eternity.'
This word is used by Lucr. also to express limited time, as below
553 aevo priore ‘the past‚' 564 aevi ‘ life-span) ‘ age?

If there were not a set limit to the breaking up and destruction of
matter, before this il would have been so fizr reduced that all growth would
be impossible ‚· for things are destroyed more rapidly than renewed, and
an infinite future could not repair the wreck of an infinite past ( 5 51— 564).
Agaue, while it is seen how with void from indivtsible particles soft things
are produced, it is inconceivable how from sffifirst·beginnings hard things
could come ( 565-576).

551. Denique: as in 199 where see n. 554. a cer. temps
‘within a· fixed time.’ 555. summum . . . auctum: ‘reach its
utmost growth of being! auctum is Munro’s emend. for finem, which
is *obviously wrong3 for finis elsewhere in Lucr. is fem„ and besides
here does not suit the sense. Lachm. reads conceptum summa aetatis
per-vadere finis. 557. diei: ‘ length‚' ‘period,’ depends on aetas-
‘duration,’ and is limited in turn by temporis. Munr0‚ however, says
