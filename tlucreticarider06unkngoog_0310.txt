248 LUCRETIUS [1. 287-

is more common. — aquae . . . natura: = aqua. Lucr. is fond of
such expressions. Cf. 2, 818 natura colori& 3, 191 natura mellis· and
the like. 287. molibus: i.e. pontis, ‘the piei-s) 289. grandia
saxa: explained by Munro as the stones of the bridge swept along by
the current. — ruit etc.: ‘it dashes to destruction everything that any-
where hinders its waves? For quicquid see n. to 3, 787. 290. de-
bent: ‘mustz’ see n. to 232· 295. etiam atque etiam: often
used by Lucr. in an emphatic testatement of his point at the close of
an argument or illustration. 297. aperto: see n. on 915 apertis.
, 299. venientis: the participle is much more vivid here than the infini-
tive would be. A. 292, e‚· G. 5363 H. 535, Ῑ. 4. 301. usurpare:
as in 4, 97 5 ea sensibus usurpare ‘ to pereeive ’ς a prae-Augustan use. —
suemus: here a dissyllable. See n. to 1, 60. 304: Cf. Sen. Ep.
Mor. 106, 8 numquid est dubium, an id, quo quid tangi potest, corpus
sit? 305. fluctifrago: found only here. 306. eaedem= scanned
&Fidem— serescunt t found only here3 derived, not from serenus, as
is sometimes stated, but from a simple stem, perhaps ser0-, from which
ser-enus also comes. See Vanicek, ‘ Etymol. Wiirterbuch,’ p. 1223.
307. umor aquai: cf. also 1, 349 liquidus umor.- 2, 197 umor aquae,-
3, 427 umor aquai. All these expressionS, like natura aquae above,
are somewhat pleonastic. 311. annis ε the connection suggests the
earlier meaning of annus ‘a circuit.’ See Var. L. L. 6, 8 tempus a
bruma ad brumam, dum sol redit, vocatur annus ; quod, utparvi circuli
anuli, sic magni dicebantur ctrcites ani, unde annus. But fixe poet had
in mind the ordinary meaning, or he would hardly have used the word
redeuntibus. cf. 5, 644, and n. 312. subter: i.e. on the inside.—
habendo· habere‘ to wear’ is not common. cf. Tib. 4, 2, 14 Vertum-

anulos habuerint. 313-4. Cf. 4, 1286-7, also Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 4,
10, 5-6:

Gutta cavat lapidem, consumitur annulus usu:
Atteritur pressa vomer aduncus humo 3

and Tib. 1, 4, 18 Longa dies molli saxa peredit aqua. Cf. also Plut. De
Lib. Educ. 4, σταγόνες μὲν γὰρ ὕδατος πέτρας κοιλαίνουσι, and the frag.
of Choerilus, πέτρην κοιλαίνει ῥανὶς ὕδατος ἐνδελεχεείῃ. The thought
has become trite in the modern literatures. 313. stilicidit for the
ἔσται, see n. to 11 favoni. Lachmann has shown that stilic-idum is the
better spelling of the word, though sa'lltkidium is generally found in
