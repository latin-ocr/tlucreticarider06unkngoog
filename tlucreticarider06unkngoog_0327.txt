sense to express ‘the least thing ’ absolutely. 617. pars 2=dimid1a
pars. In cases like this pars takes the meaning ot ‘ one-half,' ‘one-
third ' etc. according to the context. 618. praefiniet : ‘ set bounds ’
to the division. 619. minimam: supply rem.— escit: archaic
future of esse, inchoative in origin. It is found four times in the frag-
ments of the Twelve Tables and in a few places elsewhere. With the
development ot the future force from the inchoative form Words-
worth compares the use ofothe German werden ,· see his ‘ Fragments
and Specimens of Early Latin,' p. 511 ; also Roby‚ 722. Trans. here
as if intererit, dtis-tabit. 620. nil . . . distet τ = nil dats-tabat. The e
reasoning in 615-622 was borrowed by the Epicureans from the
Eleatics. Granted that matter is infinitely divisible, the least thing
as well as the greatest will be made up of an infinite number of parts;
thus there will be no difference between them, because infinities are
equal. ‘Exactly the same was the view of the Indian materialist
Kanada, who taught that if matter were infinitely divisible a grain
of sand would be “equal to a mountain, both being infinite.” See
F leming, ‘ Vocab. of Phil.' art. A tom. The argument is a paralogism,
as has often been shown. It assumes that anything which can be ⁴
divided into an infinite number ot parts is infinite, and that all infini- .
ties are ec‘lual. We conceive of space, for example, as infinitely ¹
divisible3 hence any measure in space, as a mile, an inch, is infi-
nitely divisible; but the mile and the inch are not therefore equal .
divisions of space. 625. ea: refers to the parts of the atoms; so
quae in 626. 627. illa: i.e., the atoms: quoque, i.e. as well as the
inseparable parts of which atoms are made up. 632. possunt:
supply habere5 ‘ cannot have those proper-ties which ' etc. The argu·
ment in 628-634 must be carefully distinguished from that of Demo-
critus borrowed from Zeno, “that an absolute division would leave
no magnitude remaining, and therefore nothing at all.'' See Zeller,
‘Prae-Soc. Phil.’ ii. 219. In illustration of our poet‘s position
Munro quotes Maxwell, ‘ Theory of Heat,' p. 285 ε “ We do not assert
that there is an absolute limit to the divisibility of matter3 what we
assert is that at'ter we have divided a body into a certain finite num-
ber of constituent parts called molecules‚ then any further division of
these molecules will deprive them of ·the properties whieh give rise
to the phenomena observed in the substance.” On the value of the

’ argument see Stallo, ‘Concepts ancl Theories of Mod. Phys) ch. 7.
