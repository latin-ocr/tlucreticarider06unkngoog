all uncompounded matter. . . . Now if compound bodies are so very
hard as we find some of them to be, and yet are very porous and con-
sist of parts which are only laid together, the simple particles which
are void of pores and were never yet divided must be much harder.
For such hard particles being heaped together can scarce touch one
another in more than a few points, and therefore must be separable
by much less force than is requ'isite to break a solid particle whose
parts touch in all the space between them without any potes or inter-
stices to weaken their cohesion.” Emerson represents nature as
saying :—
·‘ No ray is gone, no atom worn,
My oldest foroe is old as new,

And the fresh rose on yonder thorn ⁵
Gives back the bendiug heavens in dew.”

Suppose there is no [imit to the dwisibiliq qs matter ,· still there are
elements not as yet reduced, of which all things that exist are composed.

solution from infinite past time (577-583). All nature is under the reign
of law. This could not be ts there were not in matter elements incapable

582. discrepat: ‘it is inconsistent‚' i.e. with the assumption that
matter is infinitely divisible. The argument is a kind of reductio
ad absurdum, in which, however, the conclusion is not directly stated,
but may be readily supplied 584. generatim ι see n. to 20.
586.'quid . . . queant: queo and possum are often used absolutely in
the sense of qu. facere or agere, pos. fac. or agere. In construing quid
and the like in such cases. instead of supplying facere, as is often done,
it is better to consider them as adverbia] acc. A like constr. is met
with in other languages. For the English cf. Browning ‘ A Death in
the Desert,' ‘⁶ Lower than God, who knows all and can all ;'’ Bacon,
⁸ Essay on Great Place,' “the best condition is not to will, the second
not to can;” Shakspere ‘ Hamlet‚' “The French, who can well on
horse-back.’'—foedera naturai: the conception of law, universal,
all-potent, pervades the entire philosophy of Lucr. See p. xxxii.
587. sancitum :=sanctum ,· a rare form—quandoquidem: the ὸ·
