quo. —exitz supply quicque from cuiusque in 171 3 see n. to 15
capta. 171. corpora prima: see n. on 1, 55 primordia. 173. cer-
tis: ‘ particular.’

(2) That things do not rise from nothing is evident from the fixed sea·
sons in which all products mature. 174-18 3.

174. calore = aestate ; so frigus is sometimes used for hiemps, as
Verg. Ecl. 5, 70 ante focum si fhgus erit. Thus in Greek θάλπος is found
for θέρος, ψῦχος for χειμών. 175. fundi: see n. to 351. 178. tem-
pestates: here = ὧραι, ‘the due seasons.' Tempestas in the singular
refers to unseasonable as well as seasonable, bad as well as good,
weather3 the meaning must be determined from the context, as in
the case of valanda, which means good health or bad health accord-
ing to the connection. Cf. on the one hand 2, 32 cum tempestas aa'-
ridet,- 4, 169; 5, 13953 on the other 1, 761 tempestate coacta ,· 6, 3763
6, 458. 180. exorerentur: as in 5 exortum,where see n. 181. spa-

cilio ε ‘ union ’ς abl. of separation, while tempore is an abl. of means.

184. porro ε ‘ again.’

(3) [f things could come from nothing, living things would spring at
once to maturity, would need no time for growth. 184-191.

186. infantibu ’z see n. on 159 omnibu ’. 187. arbusta: for arbo·
res, as often in the poets; drbo'res cannot stand in hexameter verse3
see 352 and n. 189-190. The text is here corrupt and difficult.
Lachmann reads . . . ut par est semine certo crescere, resque genus ser·
vant,· which gives a grammatica] though inelegant constr. Munro
supposes that after est words have dropped out, which he supplieS‚ so

that the lines read :—

paulatim crescunt, ut par est, tempore certo,
res quoniam crescunt omnes de semine certo
crescentesque genus servant ; ut noscere possis

in which, while the Mss. reading is preserved, there is both good
sense and good constr. Munro supposes a break in the text to have
arisen from the concurrence of two lines having similar endings.
189. ut par est: ‘ as is natural! 191. sua de mate'ria: the mean-
