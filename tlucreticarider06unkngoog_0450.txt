S in the editions of 'Caesar and Cicero by the same editor,
no pains have been spared to make the book pleasing to
the eye and useful to the student. The selectionS‚ with a few
exceptionS, are short and complete in themselves. A consider-
able number of them will be found suitable for sight—reading.
The Introduction contains a sketch of the life and works of
ovid, with a short essay on Ovid as a poet, together with an
outline of Greek and Roman Mythology.
The N otes are elementary, but at the same time they aim to
suggest a poetic interpretation of the author.

william C. collar, Headmaster‚ Roxbury Latin School, Mass. : Ι am glad to
see an edition containing so good and so varied a collection from Ovid's
writings. The book seems tome to be a very conscientious piece of work,
and 1 am particularly pleased with the frequent and happy quotations, in
the notes, of passages from English poetS.

Walter A. Edwards, Principah High School, Rockford, Ill. : Ι ‚am delighted
with vit. The editor has made an excellent school-book, without thrusting
into the background the literary charm of the text he is annotating. The
abundant quotations from the English poets must materially help toward
a right appreciation and enjoyment of Ovid's poetry.

L. C. Hull, Lawrenceville School, N J- .· Professor Kelsey has again shown
how admirably he can meet the wants of good teachers. But his edition
of Ovid does more than this. It must quicken the poetic sense of even
the most prosaic teachers. I oennot help feeling that many a pupil will
thank Professor Kelsey for having shown how the same themes that in-
spired Ovid still live in our own English classics. We have had given to
us a manual of mythology, a scholarly edition of a Latin classic, and an
abundance of poetic inspiration, all at once. Ov'id did not write to eze
hibit the grammatical usages of his day, or to help make philologists; and
Professor Kelsey has not made the mistake of supposing that his verses
are best used when they are made to serve such' purposeS.

Professor George Η. white, Oberlin College: The notes are made attrac-
tive‚ and their meaning more clear, by many quotations from a wide range
of English poets. In this latter respect it is superior to every other school
edition of the ancient classics. 1 commend the book without taeerve.
