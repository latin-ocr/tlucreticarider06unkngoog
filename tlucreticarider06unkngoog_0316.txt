· begunss 419. ut est: ‘as it is: ‘as it stands.’ Munro in his 3rd
edit. takes per se with ut est and trans. ‘ all nature, then, as it exists
by itself,’ which does not seem to make as good sense as the other
constr. ς but see his n. 420. constitit in: ‘is made up of! With
this meaning consistere is followed by the simple abl. or hythe abl. with
ex or in. Lucr. has the three constructions, but in only with rebus
here. He has likewise constare re, ex re. — corpora: i.e., both atoms
and the things made up of atoms. 421. diversa: ‘ in'different
directions‚' ‘ about ’ς the common use of an adj. having the force of
an adv. — moventur: the passive of movere is often used where the
English idiom requires the active. 422. per se: refers to corpus,
not to subj. of dedicat. — esse z= existere. ÷ communis sensus:
κοινὸς νοῦς, the general conviction of men, ‘ common sense.' To this
the Stoics as well as the Epicureans appealed. Epictetus (Diss.
3, 6) thus defines it= ‘ There are certain things which men, who are
not altogether unsound, see by the common notions which all possess.
Such a constitution of the mind is named common sense.' But 'the
distinction must be carefully observed between ‘ common sense‚’ as
used in the present passage, denoting simply the general conviction
of men, and ‘common sense ’ in its popular signification, with ‘⁶ an
acquired perception or feeling of the common duties and proprieties
expected from each member of society.” The latter is the prevalent
meaning in Cicero and Seneca, and is found also Hor. Sat. 1, 3, 662
Juv. Sat. 8, 73. For full discussion of this point 588 ⁸ The Works of
Thomas Reid: ed. by Hamilton, i. 109 and ii. n. Α. § v. It is in the
tormer signification that common sense is the characteristic term of
the Scottish Philosophy. As the Epicureans believed in the abso-
lute trustworthiness of the senseS, and that from these all knowledge
comes (cf. 4, 379 et seq.), they held of course (since the senses are the
same for all men) that those things regarding which the general belief
of mankind is unanimous must be accepted as true. [The above n.
