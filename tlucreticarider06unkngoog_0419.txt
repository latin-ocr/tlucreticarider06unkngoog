534 med. mundi reg.: cf. 1, 1052 et seq. and nn. The universe

has no centre, but the world has. Lucr. nowhere gives a hint as to his ι

idea of the earth’s shape. From his rejection of the belief in the

antipodeS, however, and from what is said here of a nature beneath ’

supporting it, we may suppose that he conceived of it as flat. Epicurus

(Diog. Laert. 10, 74) says that ‘we are not to suppose that the worlds Ι

of necessity have one and the same shape.’ According to Diog.
Laert. he taught that some are spherical‚ some elliptical, and others

of other shapes. Regarding the shape of the earth, however, no defi· ’

nite statement of his has come down to us; he merely says that it
rests suspended on the air (τὴν γῆν τῷ ἀέρι ἐποχεῖσθαι). This is sug-

gestive of the view of AnaximeneS, that the earth is broad and flat, ἱ
and is supported by the air. Leucippus and Democritus supposed it ζ

to be “ an exceedingly flat cylinder, which supports itself on the air
by means of its breadth.” 537. uniter: seen. to 3, 839. 538. vi·-
vit: truly a strange word for a thorough·going materialist to apply to
the earth. Ancient thought was permeated with hylozoistic and pan-

theistic ideas; cf. n. to 514 aeterni. 544. per multo: should be
permulto. 545. quid etc.: ‘what function each thing has to per·
form! 56ο. potis: see n. to 1, 452. For the thought cf. 3, 161
etseq.

(3) The sun, the moon, and tlte stars are of about the same size that they
seem to us to be. 564-591. “

564-5. Cf. the statement of EpicuruS, Diog. Laert- 16, 91 ‘ In re· 1
gard to the size of both the sun and the other heavenly bodieS, it is ι

indeed, as far as pertains to us, such as it appears to be.’ This doc· ·.
trine seems to have been peculiar to Epicurus and his followers. ²

Leucippus and Democritus held that the sun is much larger than the
earth, and that the shadows of mountains can be traced on the

moon’s surface. Cf. Cic. De Fin. 1, 6, 203 Acad. 2, 26, 823 Plut. 1

Plac. 2, 21, 4; Sen. N. Q. 1, 3, 10. 564. solis rota: cf. 432.
566. quibus . . . cumque: tmesis. 568. illa: :patim 571. loca:
i.e.‚ corporum nostrorum. 572. filum: ‘size.’ 575. notho: ‘not

genuine,’ i.e.‚ ‘ not her own‚’ ‘ borrowed.' Whether the moon shines
with her own or with borrowed light cannot be known, and makes no
difference3 the size is not greater than it appears to be. Cf. 705 et seq.
and nn. 578. quam: supply figura. 579. prius: with 581 quam.
