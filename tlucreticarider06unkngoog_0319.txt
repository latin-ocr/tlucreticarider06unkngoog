of ‘properties' Epicurus took from Aristotle. See Arist. Met„ 10

ch. 2 lee Canonic for full discussion and citation of authdritieS.
451. permitiali: so two of the best MSS-3 perniciali is the common
reading, adopted also by Lachmann. The meaning is the same in
either case. Permitialis is found only here3 but permities ‘ destruc-
tion,’ ‘ ruin,' ‘ decay ' is several times met with. 452. potis ε here
not declined3 pote, however, is sometimes met with. Either form
is rare in classical prose, where potest is used instead—seque
greg.: tmesis; -sbgrg'gdri would not suit the metre. 453. liquor:
the i is here lengthened. 454. Lachmann has shown that this
verse is an interpolation. The datives are inconsistent with the pre-
ceding genitiveS, and the nom. intactus is a barbarism. 457. na-
tura: i.e. rei szsz‘us. Observe the elegant and forcible arrangement
of words. 459: est t :emb-tit. “Here t00,’' Munro remarks,
‘⁴ Lucr. is combating Chrysippus and the Porch, who taught that
time was not only ἀσώματον, but also like void καθ’ αὑτό τι νοούμενονἲ
πρᾶγμα.” The same argument is stated by Epicurus in Diog. Laert.
10, 24, 40. No better proot' of the surpassing poetic power of Lucr.
is needed than the contrast between the dry, hard statement of Epic.
and the spirited and lucid treatment of the same question here.
“ One of our commonest errors is to regard time as an agent. But in
reality time does nothing and is nothing.’‘ Fleming, ‘ Vocabulary of
Phil? art. Time. 460. conseq. sens.: ‘the sense apprehends.’—
aevo τ’ ‘the past,’ a rare meaning of this word. 461. instet: ‘is
present.‘ —quid . . . seq.: cf. Cic. De Sen. 19, 69nec praeteritum tempus
nunquam revertitur nec quid sequatur sciri potest. — deinde : scanned ,
demde, as often. 462-3. The doctrine that time cannot be known ’
apart from motion and rest was worked out by Aristotle. Lucr. is in
error in denying utterly its obiective existence, as he does 459. We
reach our conceptions of time and space only through experience;
indeed experience is apprehended by us only in termS, as it were, of
time and space; but that there are relations outside of ourselves cor-

responding to these conceptionS, few will deny. Lucretius’ error
originates in the notion of ‘existence ‘ held by the EpicureanS, Elea-

ticS, and most ancient philosophers. By them ‘ existence ' was predi·
cated either of matter alone, or of matter and spirit, or of matter and
void; but properly speaking the concept covers both substance, phys-
ical and spiritual, and relationS, as cause and effect, space, time. The
