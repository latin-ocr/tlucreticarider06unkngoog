of combination they assumed manifold shapes of atomS, by
means of which these could become entangled and united in
all kinds of things. The Epicureans rejected the law of neces-
sity and all final cause, supposed that atoms move downward in
empty space at the same rate, and assigned the occasion of
atoms combining to the sels-movement of some from their course.
In this, without knowing it, they were really attributing psychic
properties to the atom, and showed the influence of the old
hylozoistic conception of matter. Although they utilized this
voluntary power of the atom only in explaining the freedom os
the will, believing that everything in nature goes on rigidly in
obedience to law, the principle thus introduced was not lost
sight of, but was carried to its fullest application in the gradual
spiritualization of the atom. It was enlarged upon by Brun0, -
in the doctrine that “the elementary parts of all that exists are
the minima or monadS‚ which are to be considered as pointS‚
not absolutely unextended‚ but spherica13 they are at once
psychical and material.’' It permeates the system of Gas-
sendi, who, though he claimed simply to revive Epicureanism,
‘⁴ ascribed to the atoms force and even sensation.'’ 1 It found a
complete and final realization in the monadol'ogy of Leibnitz. For
in opposition to Spinoza’s doctrine of one universal substance
with the attributes of thought and extension‚ Leibnitz assumed
a plurality of elementary formS, which he made out to be in-
divisible points or particleS‚ “punctual unities‚'' qualitatively
different, each having a soul of its own and bearing to the sum
of all a fixed relation in a system of universal harmony. As he
emphasized'the spiritual side of these psychic atoms or monad3‚
his tendency was idealistic; and his doctrine marks a transition
from Materialism 'to Idealism. Bruno‚ Gassendi, and¹ Leibnitz
accepted the Christian conception of God, but seem to have
found it a difficult matter to reconcile this with their philosophy.

Bacon, as it has already been remarked, adopted Democritus’
conception of the atom‚ which was accepted also by Newton.
