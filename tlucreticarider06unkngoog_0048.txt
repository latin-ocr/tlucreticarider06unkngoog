their form, to force its impulse of movement3 who impressed
upon both matter and force a natural law, in accordance with
which the universe has been built up and is carried on, in the
out-working of a comprehensive divine plan. But the atheistic
and agnostic thinkerS, with the same inconsistency that charac-
terized LucretiuS, starting with chance and without a lawgiver,
assume,the reign of law, and suppose that with this atoms and
space and force and time are adequate to account for all the
facts and phenomena of the present order of things. The doc-
trine of the atom is just as consistent with a theistic as with an
atheistic theory of the universe. Lucretius indeed personified‚
deified nature. In this he is followed by some modern mate-
rialistS, while others seem to put evolution in the place of God,
and deify a process.1 In assuming the eternity of matter and
the continuity of motion, the infinity of time and space, and
numberless atoms,' as essential conditions to the coming of a
world into existence, Lucretius and the modern materialist are
at one.

Regarding the genesis of thingS, Lueretius foreshadows mod-
ern science inssthe nebular hypothesis. In his account of the
beginning of the world, as in the modern doctrine, we have
the chaotic mingling of clashing and discordant elements3 the
formation of a world-nucleus 3 the gradual differentiation of parts
composed of matter in states of unequal density. Here, how-
ever, the parallel ends. For the poet was giving range to his
imagination in a magnificent conception, adapted to his philoso-
phy from the old mythology, while the nebular hypothesis is
based upon a careful examination of the properties and relations
of the so-called elementary substanceS, framed in accordance
with the laws of force, and through experiment receives at least
a partial verification by analogy. In his ideas about the heavenly
bodies and his explanations of natural phenomena, moreover‚
Lucretius is almost everywhere adrift.² With akeen interest in

what is now termed science, but with no true scientific method‚
