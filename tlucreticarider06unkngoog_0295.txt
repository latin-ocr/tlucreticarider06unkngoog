tute, giving either tutemet or tutemet, - both, however, rare. — vatum:
Munro’s explanation of the word is the best. According to him vates
was “the oldest name for poets,’' which later “fell into complete· con-‚
tempt‚ and was discarded for poeta. virgil and succeeding writers
made vates once more a name of honor, and denoted by it an inspired
bard, -something higher than poeta. With Lucr. here and in 109 it is
a term of contempt, to denote apparently singers of old prophecies
and denouncers of coming ills.” 103. terriloquis: found only
here ; see n. on 1, 275 silvifragis. —desciscere etc.: this and the pre-
ceding line probably do not imply any distrust of Memmius’ courage
on the part of the poet, but through him are intended to reach and with
the following lines remove the natural timidity of many readers. Mem·
miuS, however, as already remarked, seems not to have been inclined
toward Epicureanism. 105. somnia etc.: cf. the words of the
Epicurean in Cic. N. D. 1, 16, 42 exposui fere non philosophorum iudi·
cia, sed delirantium som n ia. Nec enim multo absurdiora sunt ea, quae
poetarum vocibus fusa ipsa suavitate nocuerunt, etc. Cf. also Pers. Sat.
3, 83. 106. timore: cf. 3. 37 and n. 107. finem: always fem.
in Lucr. 109. religionibus : i.e. the religious fears inspired by the
seers. 110. ratio: ‘way ⁶—restandi: = resti-tendi. 111. poenas:

acc. after the neuter of the gerundive with est. This constr. is very rare
⁴ except in Lucr. and Varro; it resembles the use of the acc. after ver-
balnouns in tio, common in Plautus. Roby, ‘Gr.' Vol. II. Pref. p. lxxii.
et seq. gives full list of examples. See also Kiihner‚ ‘Ausfiihn Gram.

112. ignoratur: in' making ignorance the cause of unhappiness Lucr.
was in sympathy with the general spirit of ancient philosophy. After
the time of Socrates most of the schools, whatever their other differ-
enceS, based virtu'e on rational action, and in consequence held also
that only the wise could be really happy. —natura animai: this forms
the subjectos book third. See n. to 3, 161. 113. nata sit: i.e.
formed along with the body and born with it, the Epicurean view. —
an: on the omission of utrum see A. 211, g,· H. 353, 2.—nascenti·
bus: supply hominibus. - insinuetur: insinuare ‘to steal into,' ‘ force
one’s way into,' is a favorite word of Lucr. It is used by him with
dat„ or with se and acc. with per or i,n acc. with pcr or in without other
ace„ or with simple ace. as 116 below; 4, 10303 5, 73. The belief that
souls find their way into human bodies at birth belongs to the doc·
