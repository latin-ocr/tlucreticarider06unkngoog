But, you say, air, earth, water, beat are necasfitl for production an(t
growtlz of things. Quite true, ancl further, we cannot live without sood

words. 803-829.

803. At ε -- &aaa γάρ, ‘But,' emphatic. At is frequently thus used
to introduce an objection of a real or imaginary opponent. 805.
tempestas: see n. to 178. The weather by its showers furnishes
