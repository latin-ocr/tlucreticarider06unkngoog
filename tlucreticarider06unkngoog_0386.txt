324 Lucam-ms [111. 784-

784-797. Repeated with slight change 5, 128-141. 787. quic-
quit = quicque; cf. 1, 289. 790. posset . . . prius: ‘for this
(which follows) would be much more likely to happen than that'
(the existence of the soul apart from the body). Lachmann reads
Quid si posset enim ? Multo prius etc. Suppose the mind, instead οἱ
being located in the beart, were to be placed in the head or shoul—
ders or any other part, still it would be in the body. 793. vase:
see n. to 440. 801. putare (mortale et eternum) posse consentire et
fitne-i etc. mutua has an adverbial force, as several times in Lucr.
See Roby, 1096-7. 806-818 = 5, 351-363: “ They here interrupt

x the argument, and are, of course, one of the many glosses with which
some reader has wished either to explain or refute the poet by
quoting his own verses for or against him, as the case may be.''
This passage has often been reckoned the twenty-seventh argument
against the immortality of the soul, making the following the twenty·
eighth.

(27) But the soul may be thought immor-tal because it is· protectedftom
destruc-tim agent-ies: on the contrary, it suffers not merely from the ills of
the body, but also from cares and fears and other troubles os its own. ·

819-829.

819. habendast : supply anima. 823. After this verse a vs,
seems to have been lostrwhich Lachmann thus supplies: Multa tamen
tangunt animam mala, multa pericla. 824. praet. en. quam quod:

‘ For besides that.’ A like tmesis of praeterquam occurs in Cic. De
Leg. 3, 19, 45. — aegret z found only here.

2. Conclusions based on the oul's mort l··ty. .
830-1094.

(1) Since the soul is mortal, death is nothing-to us ‚· for the future will
be to us as the past was before our birth. E ven {f the soul lim aster death
we shall not, since our personali& is made up by the um‘on of soul aad&
body. A nd {f hereafler sometime the atoms of our body and soul shall sohyd
collect as to make a living form, we shall not exist, because the thread of ⁸
identity will have been broken. 8 30-869.

830 et seq. On the Epicurean view of death see p. xxxv.; consult
