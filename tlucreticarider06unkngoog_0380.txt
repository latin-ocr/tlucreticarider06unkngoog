615. animi etc. τ for the synonyms see n. to 94. 616. unis : the
pl. of unus occurs also 5, 897. Neue (‘ Formenlehre,' ii. 144) gives
over forty instances of this usage. 619-20 et [redditum est cuique]
ubi creatum possit durare atque [red. est cuique] esse (= existere) etc.:
quicquid = quicque ; both cuique and quicquid are used in a general
sense, without particular reference to the body. Trans. with Mayor:
‘There is a law which appoints to each several thing its place of
birth, its place to abide in, and its existing with such a manifold
organization of joints that’ ete. Munro, however, thinks cuique and
quicquid refer to the parts of the body, and supposes after 619 two
verses have been lost, which he thus supplies z Certum ac dispositum
naturae legibu’ constat. Hoc fieri nostrum quoque corpus foedere debet,
Atque etc. 620. partitis: Bernays and Munro for pro totis ‚· Lach-
mann has perstetis. 623. fluminibus: supply in.

(15) [f the soul is to exist by itself, it must needs have the five senses ,⁸
but these cannot exest apart from tlte body. 624-63 3.

626. fac. est ε ‘we must suppose.’ 628. Acherunte ε see
Ι n. to 978. 629. pictores: thus Polygnotus painted scenes from
the descent of Ulysses to the Lower World on the walls of the court of
the Cnidians at Delphi. -- scriptorum: such as Homer. 630. in-
tro dux. : in the time of Lucretius the parts of many compounds had
not fully coalesced. 631. sorsum: for seorsum ,· ‘ apart‚’ i.e.,
from the body. 632. animae: dat.; esse = existere. 633. au·
ditu: Munro, for auditume at the best an awkward constr.; Lach-
mann and Bernays read haud igitur.

(16) The soul permeates the entire body ,⁰ when parts qf this are cut

qff tlte soul must be severed, since there cannot be separate souls for every
part5 but whatever can be divided is mortal. 634-669.

634 et seq. This and several other arguments of Lucr. are clearly
stated by Tyndall, ‘ Fragments of Science,' 5 edit„ p. 498 ct seq. (Bel-
fast Address). 635. totum: supply corpus.—animale ι almost
= animans ; ef. 2, 727 animalia corpora. 638. procul dubio: see
n. to 1, 812. 639. dissicietur: = disicietur (less correetly des-
jicietur); dissicere for disicere is found a few times in MSS. of other
writers. 640. quod: pron.; supply id as subject to abnuit.
