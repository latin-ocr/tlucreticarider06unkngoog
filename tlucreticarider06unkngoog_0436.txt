374 Lucam-ms [v. 1028—

roundingS. . . . Later, in each nation particular terms were invented
and put into usage by authority, that relations might be less ambigu-
ous and speech more concise. The wise, too, bringing into experience
things not apprehended by the senses made sounds to express them;
and these terms came into use partly of necessity in the case of men
-desiring to express the same ideas, partly through those who follow·
ing reason employed them in the same sense.' Most writers on the
origin of Language agree with Lucr. in putting it after the first steps
of progress. Cf. Haeckel, ‘ Nat. Hist. of Creation‚’ ii. 300: “The
origin of articulate language must be looked upon as only a later, and
the most important, stage in the process of the development of Man.”
The question whether language was in its origin natural or conven-
tional was much discussed in antiquity3 cf. Aul. Gel. 10, 4. Most
of the philosophers held the view of Lucr., which is essentially that
most widely adopted to-day, having as its champions Darwin (⁸ Descent
of Man‚’ i. 52-6o)‚ as well as many philologists. 1029. expressit

1053. quid facto: an expression rare outside of comedy. For the
constr. see n. to 1, 1051. 1056-8. The possession of a capacity
impels to the use and development of it. Having the capacity to
speak, man learned to speak. 1062. apertis: cf. n. to 1, 915.
1063 et seq. Darwin in discussing the natural origin of language
uses the same illustration for the same purpose as Lucr.; ‘Descent
of Man‚' i. 52: “Although barking is a new art, no doubt the wild
species, the parents of the dog, expressed their feelings by eries of
various kinds. With the domesticated dog we have the bark of eager-
ness, as in the chase; that of anger3 the yelping or howling bark of
despair, as when shut up3 that of joy, as when starting on a walk
with his master ; and the very distinct one of demand or supplication,
as when'wishing for a door or window to be opened.’' 1066. et :
‘than ' 1071. baubantur: found only here 3 the meaning is clear
from the context. 1085. corvorum: for the myths and beliefs
