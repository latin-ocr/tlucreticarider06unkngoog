958. Omne etc.: ‘the existing universe is bounded in none of its
dimensions.' nul. reg. ,vi.: Munro well explains, ‘ take which-
ever of the roads through the universe you please‚ at no point in any
of them will you reach its bound.' Cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10,
24, 41-2: ‘ And moreover the universe is infinite3 for that which
is limited has an outside, and the outside is perceived in relation to
something else. So that, not having an outside, it has no boundary3
and, not having a boundary, it must be infinite and not limited.' The
Stoics, following Aristotle, taught that the universe is limited‚ but that
outside of it there is unlimited extent of void space. The question
whether or not the universe is finite was one that aroused sharp con-
troversy long after Lucretius' day. Cf. Lucian ‘ Ikaromenippus, 8 καὶ

φουσι, τοῖς δὲ ἀτελὲς τοῦτο εἶναι ὑπολαμβάνουσιν. For the view of
a modern materialist, cf. Haeckel.. ‘Nat. Hist. of Creation‚’ ch. 13
(i. p. 324) ε “ The universe is unlimited and immeasurable in both space
and time. Nor can we imagine a beginning or end to the uninter—
rupted and eternal motion in which all particles of the universe are
always engaged. . . . The great laws of the conservation of force and
the conservation of matter, the foundations of our whole conception
of motion, admit of no other supposition. The universe, so far as it
is cognizable to human capability, appears as a connected chain of
material phenomena of motion, necessitating a continual change of
forms. Every form, as the temporary result of a multiplicity of phe-
nomena οἱ motion, is as such perishable and of limited duration. But,
in the continual change of forms, matter and the motion inseparable
from it remain eternal and indestructible.’' Cf. nn. on 150 and 1021.
