LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xxvii

shape as the bodies from which they come, of movement’ incon-
ceivably swift.¹ From the contact of these with the eyes vision
results, A square tower in the distance appears round, because
the idols in passing through the air are blamed, and have the
sharp corners worn down. From polished surfaces the idols
rebound3 hence the reflection of mirrorS. But they pass
through certain substanceS, as glaSS‚ so that the sight is not
hindered. To men wjth the jaundice things look greenish be-
cause of the greenish particles thrown off from the eyeS‚ which
meet the coming idois and tinge them with that hue. The eyes
cannot bear to look at the sun because of the impinging force of
its idois and the seeds of fire in them.2 The sense of hearing
distinguishes different sounds according to the different kinds of
atoms in them3 for that sound is of material nature is made

results from the friction of sound-atoms as they pass out of
the throat. The penetrating power of sounds shows how
minute the sound-atonis must be.⁸ The senses of smell and
taste experience pleasure from the contact of smooth atoms, dis-
comfort from the presence of those rough or jagged.4

The finest idols even penetrate directiy to the mind, which
is fitted thus to receive impressions from its physical nature.
Sometimes there 1s a mingling and confusion of idols 1n the air,
and mongrel forms seem to be perceived to which there is no

idols come, and then men have dream5‚ sometimes even horrid
visions of monsters and human figures larger than life, and the
forms of the dead.⁷ In the relation of the senses to the things
perceived and the phenomena of sensation no evidence of design
