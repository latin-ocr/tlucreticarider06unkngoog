-LUCRE‘rlUs As A PmLosoPHER xvii

A great'impulse was given to education, especially that part of
it concerned with the training of the orator. With progressive
enlightenment the old religion lost its hold on the higher classes

Something was needed to take its place as a guide to duty.-

Shaking off the shackles of a confused and corrupting poly-
theism, the best minds of Rome awoke to a full realization of
the mysteries of existence, and sought a theory of things in
which they could find rest. The Greek philosophy seemed to

to the Roman character, and had the greatest following. The
Peripatetic differed from the Stoic mainly in the position that
in comparison with virtue other things are entitled to considera·
