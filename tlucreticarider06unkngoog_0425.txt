shapes it may assume, like air, or by interpositions of another body,
or in any of the ways in which we speak of similar phenomena hap-
pening before our eyes; with this condition, however, that one do not
devote himself to any one opinion, rejecting the others inconsider-
ately, and, being ignorant of what it is possible, what impossible, to
explain, on this account become desirous of explaining things that
cannot be known. Perhaps the moon shines by her own light,
perhaps she gets it from the sun; for among us one sees many things
having light of their own, and many shining by reflection. . . . The
appearance of a face in the moon may be due to a transposition of
parts, or to the interposition of some body; or to any other causes of
such character that they are able to account for appearances of this
kind.’ 733. privos: see n. to 3, 723. 734. parte: ‘room,' a
signification of pars found nowhere else, according to Munro. 737.
Venus: see n. to 1, 2. Edd. notice the suggestion in the following
lines of a procession, or, as Munro styles it, “ a pantomimic representa·
tion '’ of the four seasons. —praenuntius: to whom does this refer?
The connection suggests Zephyrus3 because the west wind is a marked

, feature of the south Italian spring, and the winds were represented as

winged (pennatus). N. P. Howard, followed by Mum-0, quotes 4, 1057
namque voluptatem praesagit muta cupide, and thinks the reference is
to Cupid, — a well-chosen interpretation ; Flora follows “ on the steps
of Zephyr, in advance of· Spring, VenuS, and Cupid, and strews their
path with flowers.’' 739. viai cuncta: see n. to 1, 86. 741.
inde loci.: see n. to 443. 742. etesia flabra : cf. 6, 716. During
June, July‚ and August in Central and Southern Italy winds blow from
the north and northeast with great regularity3 they were hence called
etesiae (ἐτησίαι) because of their annual recurrence. Cf. Cic. N. D. 2,
53, 131 quam salutaris non modo hominum sed etiam pecudum generi, eis
denique omnibus quae oriuntur e terra, ventos Etesias ,Ι quorum flatu
nimii temperantur calores ; ab isdem etiam maritimi cursus celeres et certi
diriguntur. 745. Volturnus: supply ventus. 746. bruma: the
severest part of winter comes after the shortest day3 hence hiemps

sequitur hanc etc. 749. rusus: see u. to 3, 1001.

body passing between it and the earth, or by the dying out of its fires ;
those of the moon, by the earth cutting qff the lagrkt received from the sun,
