288 · LUCRETIUS [1. 1033—

i

1033. summissa gens: cf. 8. The expression implies the springing
of living things from the earth, explained at length 5, 771 et seq.
1034. vivant: = durent by poetic license, Munro thinks. The an-
cients generally seem to have supposed the heavenly bodies endowed
with life. See n. on 5, 523. 1036. ex infla: as in 1001, where
see n. 1038. Cf. 194. 1041. viai: gen. ofseparation after
aversa ,· a Greek constr. A. 243,j; Rem.; H. 410, v. 4. 1043. quae-
cumque: trans. as if quaeq but quaecumq. has a peculiar force, irn-
plying that it covers in entirety, altogether, that which it represents.
1044. enim: ⁸ indeed,' ‘it is true ’3 beware of always trans. enim
‘fors 1044. part. monz i.e.‚ keep a portion of the sum of
matter stable, and thus hinder it from flying apart into space.
1045. veniant: the subj. is due to the idea of purpose involved.

’ A. 328; G. 574; H. 519. II. 2.—queatur: the passive forms of queo

and possum are occasionally found, in the older writerS‚ with a passive
infinitive. Neue, ‘ Formenl.’ ii. 603 and 609, gives a full collection of
examples. Cf. 3, 1010 potestur. 1046· et seq. As the blows are
forced to rebound‚ matter is thus freed from pressure3 hence there
must be an infinite supply of matter or the universe would fly into
pieces. 1050. et tamen: the expression is elliptical. The
meaning in full is ‘and (though what I have said is true) yet.'
1051. opus est: predicate, with vtis as subject. The more common
constr. of opus estwith the abl. is found 1, 206; 5, 1053; 6, 1081.

4. The Universe has no centre. 1052-1113.

Here is no centre in the universe toward which all things tend. To
suppose that there are antipodes is rank folly ,· in infinite space there can
be no centre, and if there could be, things would not necessarily tend toward
it any more than be repelledfl‘om it. Further, there can be no place where
bodies lose their weigrht and are able to be sustained by void. 105 2-1082.

1052. Illud, etc.: see n. to 80. —fuge : fugere with the infinitive is
not uncommon. See Kiihner, ‘AusL Gram.’ ἓ 124, 1, a). 1053.
medium: ‘centre.' Most of the ancient philosophers taught that
the earth is at the centre of the universe. Pythagoras supposed
that earth, sun, and the other heavenly bodies move about a central
fite. In the following argument the poet, doubtless, intends directly
to combat the Stoics, who held that the earth was first formed, the
