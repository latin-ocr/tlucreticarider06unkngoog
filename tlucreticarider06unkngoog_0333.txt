Nor can air or water or earth be taken as the primitive matter.
705-711.

707. principium: see n. on 1, 55 primordia—aera: the acc. of
ab'r generally has the Greek form, but ae‘rem is found a few times;
so the acc. of aether is aethera, rarely aetherem. Anaximenes and ¹
Diogenes of Apellonia were the two principa} philosophers who ’
taught that air is the single primal element. For full discussion, with ·
citations from original authoritieS‚ see Zeller, ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil.’ vol. i.
708. umorem: that water is the ultimate matter was the teaching of (
Thales and Hippo. See Zeller ut sup„ or Ritter, ‘ Hist. of Anc. Phil.’
vol. i. 709. terram: Aristode (Met. 1, 8—a chapter in which the s
doctrine ot a single material cause is ably criticised) states that none Ι
of the philosophers took earth alone to be the primal substrate; but ¹
this view has been sometimes attributed to the poet PherecydeS, and ⁸
even to Xenophanes. See Zeller, ut sup. i. 567-8. 710. vertier := i

2. Nor is matter made up of two or four primal
elements combined. 712-829.

713. aera iun. etc.: no philosopher of prominence took either air ²
and fire, or water and earth as the true primitive elements3 but the
former view is assigned to Oenopides of Chius, the latter sometimes
erroneously to Xenophanes ; see ref. on 708. 715. anima: for
ab're ,· cf. cic. Tusc. Disp. 1, 26, 6 5 si deus aut anima aut 1nger est, idem
est animus ; but this use of an. is rare in prose.—imbri: poet. for
aqua. The abl. more often ends in e. 716. Empedocles: one of
the most important of the prae-Socratic philosophers, b. at Agrigen-
tum probably in the first decade of the fifth cent. B.c. In his lifetime
he was regarded not merely as a philosopher but also as a seer and
prophet, and seems to have welcomed the veneration of the masses‚
who looked on him with deepest awe. He taught that there are four
primal elements, air, tire, water, and earth3 but to the material causes
he added two quasi-spiritual ones, love and strife (see n. on 31).
These agencies alternately acting upon the four kinds of matter cause
combination and dissolution. At first, through the influence of love,
there was perfect union of the elementS. Then strife gradually brought
about a complete separation. But by love a partial combination was
