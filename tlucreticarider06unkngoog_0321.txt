iii. THE NATURE OF MATrER.

A. THE EPICUREAN V1Ew. 483-634.

1. AtomS, of which matter is made up, are solid,
‘ without void. 483—527.

T hat there is anything absolutely solid is not known from the senses,
but through reason. 48 3- 502.

483 et seq. That these lines embody the view of Democritus is
apparent from Diog. Laert. 9, 44. The thought is exactly that of
Epicurus id. 10, 24, 40-41: ‘Of bodies some, indeed, are combina-
tionS, others are (the elements) out of which the combinations have
been made. The latter now are indivisible (ἄτομα) and unchange-
able; else indeed all things would be reduced to non-existence. But
of their own power in the dissolution of the combinations they sur-

, vive, because in their nature they are full, and thus show no aspect of ·

weakness‚ nor any mode in which they can be destroyed. Therefore,
of necessity the first principles of things are indivisible bodies.' Cf.
the statement of Sir Isaac Newton: “It seems probable that God
in the beginning formed matter in solid masses, hard, impenetrable,
moveable particles of ¹such size, figureS‚ and with such other proper-
ties and in such proportions to space, as most conduced to the end

, for which he formed them ; and that these primitive particles, being

solid, are incomparably harder than any porous body compounded
of them, — even so very hard as never to wear or to break in pieceS.'’
See Lange, ‘ Hist. of Materialism,’ section 3, ch. 33 ‘ Popular Science
Monthly,' 1881, p. 837. Cf. also Herbert Spencer, ‘ Prin. of Psychol·
ogy‚' 3d Am. edit. i. 155: “There is reason to suspect that the so·
called simple substances are themselves compound3 and that there is
but one ultimate form of matter, out of which the successively more
complex forms of matter are built up. By the different grouping of
units, and by the combinations of the unlike groups each with its own
kind and each with other kinds, it is supposed that there have been
produced the kinds of matter we call elementary3 just as, by further
composition simultaneously carried on, these produce further varie-
ties and complexities.” See also Zeller, ‘ Prae-Socrat. Phil! ii. 220-1,
