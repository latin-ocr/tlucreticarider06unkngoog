1. Invocation to Venus.

ι Venus is addressed as the lg‘feubestmving power throughout the realms
qs being, and is besought to give the poet aid while he sets forth in verse
‘the nature qf things'; and may she meanwhile also keep back sterce
Mars from war, that the Roman folk may enjoy calm peace, and thus
Memmius, his countty’s safeguard, have leals-ure to con the verses that
for him are made. 1-43.

1. Aeneadumt ‘the Aeneadae,' i. e. the Romans. The short
form of the gen. pl. of the first decl. (cf. Gk. -όων, div) is archaic3 it
is confined to a few words of Greek origin, nouns in -gena and -coIa,
and patrqnymics in -des. Lucretius, has both agricolum (4, 586) and
agricolarum (2, 1 161 and 6, 1260). The form Aeneadum, first met with
here, was used later by Vergil, Ovid, and the poets of the decline.1 —
genetrix: Venus, as ancestress of the Romans. Veneration was

paid to Venus Genetrix particularly by the Caesars, who claimed ’

descent from her. Julius Caesar embellished his new forum by a
temple to her, in which was placed a statue of the·goddess by Arcesi-
laus; and a representation of her was also stamped on coins. See
Mitchell, ‘Hist. of Ancient Sculpture,’ p, 666. There is a statue
of Venus Genetrix (Venere Genetrice) at Florence.—divom: -um
