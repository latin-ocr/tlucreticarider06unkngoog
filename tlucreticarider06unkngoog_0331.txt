ignis· potesse etc Like the English d o th i s id facere often takes the
place of a clause. The reasoning in 665-9 seems to be: In no other
way than through void can rarefaction and condensation of fire take
place; but void these philosophers utterly reject3 so then their notion
of a primitive fire-essence is exploded, and they must fall back to the
position that all things existent are produced from nothing.

670-1. These lines are repeated 1, 792—33 2, 753—4; 3, 519—520, to
emphasize the doctrine that each thing has a limited power, a circum-
scribed sphere of existence, outside of which change of form and
destruction will meet it. See n. to 76. 672. proinde: in Lucr.
usually scanned as a dissyllable3 ⁴ hence,' ⁴ therefore? — aliquit : see
n. to 469 aliut. — ollis: archaic for illis ; common in Lucr. The root
is ol· as in olim. 673. tibi: ethical dat.,frequent in Lucr. In Eng-
lish the pronouns of the first and second persons are thus used often
by the earlier, sometimes even by the later writers. Cf. Shakspere,
⁶ King Henry Fourth,’ Part 1, 4, 3, ‘⁴ Cut me off the heads Of all the “
favorites; ” Carlyle, ‘ F rederick the Great,' Bk. 2, ch. 11 “ A terrible
dragon of a woman. . . . claps you an iron cap on her head, and takes
the field where need is.'’ For full discussion see Maetzner, ⁴ English ‚
Grammar,' Am. edit. ii. 211.

676—7. Cf. the words of Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 2,4‚ 54: ‘ In
the dissolution of combined bodies of necessity there remains some-
thing solid and indestructible‚ which will not undergo change into the
non-existent nor from it. Changes, however, it will undergo, in most
cases by mutation of partS, but in some by the coming and going of
atoms 1. . . ἀλλὰ κατὰ μεταθὲσε ι ς ἐν πολλοῖς· ἐπὶ τινῶν δέ, κατὰ
προσόδους καὶ ἀφόδους] 678. conv. corp. sese: a kind of
middle use, not uncommon in Latin; trans. as passive. A similar
idiom is very frequent in the French and German reflexive verbs,
683. crearent: for. subject refer back to 679 haec {quea corpora.
684. ita. ε here as often looks forward to that which follows. 685.
concursus ε see n. to 633-4: orde, arrangement of atoms in the mass : '
positura, position, relative to other atoms3 figurae, ‘ shapes,' fully
discussed 2, 333-580. 687. naturam: i.e. of thingS, not of atoms, ³
because these are incapable of change. 688-9. These lines refer
to the Epicurean theory of sense-perception, that from the surfaces of
things there are continually thrown off thin filins of matter that strike
upon our senseS, and thus by impact excite sensation. For fuller dis
cussion see 4, 42 et seq.. and p. xxvi. 688. rei: scanned νὲῑ,· cf.
