LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxxi

In the spaces between the worlds the gods dwell. Their
bodies are of the most subtile matter. They have nothing to do
with the on-going of things or the life of men; they enjoy
peace that can never be disturbed‚ bliss incapable of increase.
and unending.² The present order of things is too sull of im-
perfection to admit of divine workmanship3 and the gods, even
if able to make the world, could have had no motive to trouble
themselves with creating, nor model to work from. There is no
divine power in the universe, no shaping and directing mind.²
There is no design in the present order of things. All results
from the chance concurrence of atoms moving from eternity in
infinite space.⁸ Nothing exists but something exactly like it in
the past was, or in the present is, or in the future shall be; for
in the infinity of time and space like conditions will be repeated,
like results follow. Perhaps the matter that now makes up our
body and soul in far distant time may just as now be gathered
and united in a breathing form3 yet that will not be the pres-
ent self, since the thread of personal identity will have been
broken.⁴

N evertheleSS‚ the chance that presides over the genesis and
dissolution of all things is not mere accident. There is a fixed
order in things, Lucretius well illustrates the legal trend of the
Roman mind; he grasped the unity and harmony that underlie
all natural processes much more clearly than his master. No
one ever held more firmly that nothing can happen without
cause. Behind the proximate he is ever seeking the ultimate.
To him the universe is the manifestation of eternal change
under the reign of laW. This is why he rejects with so bitter
scorn the paltry gods of the mythology. Pitiable creatures they
were, each with his circumscribed sphere of activity, dividing
the universe up into so many parm, and all the time wrangling
about trenching on each other’s prerogatives, sporting with
natural forceS, full of jealousies and bickeringsl To LucretiuS,
