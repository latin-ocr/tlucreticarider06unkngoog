LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xlv

in a tone of perfect assurance he gives expression to mere
guesseS‚ mentioning several possible causes of anything when·
ever he can. His principal concern is always to show how
matters move on without divine power. Yet in several instances
he hits upon theories that are generally thought to be dis-
tinctively modern.

Life, ancient atomism taught, originated of itself from certain
combinations of atomS. In regard to this, again, modern atom-
ists are divided. The theistic believe that above and behind
the chemical equilibrium of the organism there is an elusive
something which presides over it, which can bave an origin in
no possible combination of matter acted upon by force alone,
which can come only from some higher power. But the mate-
rialists hold, with LucretiuS, that life is spontaneously produced
in matter under certain conditions. There is, however, this dif-
ference. Lucretius assumed that all the present types of living
thingS‚ with many others that have died out, came into being
and sprang directly from crass matter when the earth was new,
and have not changed. He believed in the simultaneous origin
and invariability of species. Scientific investigation now points
to a common physical basis of life in protoplasm. The advo-
cates of evolution‚ observing in the scale of being a gradual
ascent from the lowest to the highest formS‚ hold that the low-
est came into existence first; and that the higher have been
developed from the lower by gradual and progressive differen-
tiation‚ either in unbroken succession from the simplest organic
existence up to man, or with special creations at certain points,
The theistic evolationist finds the origin of protoplasm in the
creative act of God, and sees in the development of formS‚ either
with or without special creations at certain pointS, the unfolding
of a divine plan ε the atheistic and the agnostic eliminate from
the process everything ex'cept matter, force, and time; make
protoplasm a spontaneous product‚ and the ascending scale of
being an undirected accident within the limitation of certain
natural IaWS, the existence and operation of which are not
accounted for. Lucretius makes no attempt to bridge over the
