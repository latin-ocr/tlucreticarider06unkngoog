hastam . . . Contorsit. 978. fini: a rare form of the abl. in this
word3 probably a survival from an old loc. form. 979. foras:
‘forth,' ‘forward,’ without stopping at all. . 983. ⁴ the room for
ssight ’ will always prolong the power ot* ssight. Edd. notice that ‘⁴ this
illustration was suggested to Lucr. by the Roman mode of declaring
war. In the words of Livy, 1, 32, 12 fieri solitum utfitialzs hastam . . .
adfines eorum ferra . . . hastam in fines eorum emittebat. You cannot
go outside of the omne to fling a spear into a neighbor's bounds.”
Munro compares a striking illustration of Locke, ‘Essay on the
Human Understanding,’ 2, 13, 21: “I would ask whether, if God “
placed a man at the· extremity of corporeal beings, he could not
stretch his hand beyond his body? If he could, then he would put
his arm where there was before space without body; and if there he
spread his fingerS, there would still be space between them without
body. If he would not stretch out his hand, it must be because of
some externa] hindrance. . . . Ι would fain meet with that thinking
man that can in his thoughts set any bounds to space.”

2. Space is infinite. 988—1007.

[s space were not infinite, matter by its own weaegrht long ago would
have settled in solid mass in the lowest part, thus rendering motion
impossible. 988-1007.

οἱ the essential properties of the atoms.— confluxet: for confluxis-
set. See n. to 233 consumpse. 996—1001. On the eternal down-
ward motion of the atoms see 2, 80-141 ; cf n. on 1058 sursum,- Epi-
curus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 43 and 473 Cic. N. D. 1, 20, 54; see
also p. xxv. Modern atomists insist on the perpetual movement of
atoms, but explain it for the most part by the wave theory. See the
quotation from Haeckel n. to 9583 cf. Spencer ‘ Prin. of Psychology,’
Pt. 5, ch. 10: “ In the minutest visible fragment of matter there are
milliens of units vibrating with unimaginable speed.'’ . . . In the
ether ⁴⁸ each complex molecule of matter oscillating as 'a whole — nay,
each separate member of it independently oscillating-causes respon·
sive movements in adjacent ethei-eal moleculeS, and these in remoter
ones without limit 3 ” and ‘⁴ molecules of each kind are specially affected
by molecules οἱ the same kind existing in the farthest regions of
space. Units of sodium on which the sunlight falls heat in unison
