was written before seeing Munro’s n., in which the same passage of
Hamilton is referred t0, quoted from Mayor on Juvenal 8, 7 3.]

423. cui . . . queamus: ‘ and unless at the very outset our belief in
this shall be firmly grounded, there will be nothing to which we can
appeal on hidden things in order to prove anything by reasoning of
mind.’ Cui, as Munro remarkS, depends on fides5 it refers to com-
munis sensus. Is there not here an appeal to consciousneSS, based on
the deliverances of the consciousness of men in general? “ That our
immediate consciousness‚ if competent to prove anything‚ must be
competent to prove everything it avoucheS, is a principle which none
have been found, at least openly, to deny.” Hamilton, ut sup. n. Α.
5 ii. In last analysis, then, in the appeal to the direct knowledge,
the irresistible conviction of the ego, the position of Lucr. is that of
the Scottish philosophy.—valebit= fut„ where the Eng. idiom gen-

erally prefers the present. 426. quod: grammatically the ante-
cedent is epatium, but logoically it is the concept expressed by the two
words, locus and spatium. 427. foret == existeret. Forem is used

instead of essem, particularly in conditional sentences and clauses
expressing purpose. It is rare in Cicero. See Madvig, 377, obs· 2.
For the argument cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 40 ‘ If what
we call the void, or space, the intangible nature, did not exist, bodies
would not have a place in which to exist, nor throughout which they
could move, as we see they do move.’ 429. supera :- old form
of supra, probably at first an abl. from superus. For use see n. on
66 contra. The prep. use is found 6, 505. cf. 4, 6723 5, 1407.
431. Observe the chiastic arrangement. 432. quod: quae might
have been expected, attracted to natura. — quasi etc. = ‘might count,
as it were, as a third nature.'—numero= somewhat pleonastic: nu-
mero, literally ⁸ by count,' is often thus attached to expressions of
number, having lost its original force and merely strengthening the
expression. So saepe numero. 433. Whatever has existence must
itself be something. 434. tactus: ‘touch‚’ i.e., power of resist-
ance to the senses‚ of awakening sensation by contact. ——quamvisz
with lev. exig—levis exiguusque: ‘light and delicate’; the latter
word expresses a less degree os fineness or minuteness than the
former. 435. augmine: goes with augebit. —dum sit: ‘provided
it (really) exists.' 43⁶· numerum: ‘quantity.’—summ.-seq.:
i-e., summae omnium rer-um iungetur. No matter how small anything
is that is tangible, it 'is a part of the mass or body of the universe.
