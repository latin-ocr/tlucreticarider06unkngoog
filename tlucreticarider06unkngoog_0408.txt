346 LUCRETIUS [v. 275-

and the ancients in general, as regards the nature of chemical changes.
Stin, 275-7 taken loosely embody an important fact, that innumerable
invisible bodies are present in the atmosphere, constantly passing off
from things or coming into relation with them; the error, of course,
lies in supposing that these can become air. 276. contra: see n.
to 1, 663 here, of course, in a logical sense. 280. reccidere: see
n. to 1, 228. 284. prim. quicq. etc.= ‘ every preceding emission of
brightness is quite lost to it, wherever it falls! 285. hinc: refers
to what follows, as indicated by the punctuation. 287. inter
qu. rumpere t tmesis. 288. inferior: i.e., beneath the cloud.
289. qua: goes with cumque. 295. lychini: Munro, for lyclim' ,-
Lachmann writes lychni, the common form of the word; but Munro

thinks Lucr. knew only the trisyllabic form, “whether he wrote lychim‘
or luchina* or lichini5 or even one of the still older forms lucini or

licini? The pendentes lychini were lamps suspended by chains from
the ceiling. With this line cf. Vei-g. Aen. 1, 726 dependent lychni laque-
aribus aureas,- see MacrobiuS, Sat. 6, 1, 18. 296. taedae: ¹slips of
pine, used for light in processionS, and for going into dark p'laces3
sometimes also for torture3 cf. 3, 1017. They correspond to the
‘ pine knots ' so much used in the South and in frontier settlements.
299—301. The place of the perishing light is so quickly and continu·
ously supplied by new light that no change is noticed.

3. Rocks and the most enduring stmctures finally yield to tt'me, and
decay. 306-317.

4. The enveloping heaven, iſs as some say, it begets all things from
itself and receives them back again, thus ever changing must be monol.

318-323.

309-10. Ironical. Cf. 2, 1100-4. 310. naturae foedera:
see n. to 1, 586. 312. sene: Munr0, for cumque. Lachmann
reads the line quaesere proporro vetitumque senescere credas, in which
there seems to be unnecessary change ; sene, i.e. se·ne‚ not from senex.
Trans. ‘ Ask for themselves as well whether you ’d believe that t h e y
decay with years? ’ 313. silices: see n. to 1, 571. 316. quae ε
= si ea. 318. hoc: i.e., caelum. Cf. n. to 1, 250 pater aether.
320. quidam ε Pacuvius and the like. Edd. quote a passage of Pac.
