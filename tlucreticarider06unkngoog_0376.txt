314 LUCRE‘ran [111. 459-

esse, quod doleat, quin id aegrum esse quoque possit ; quod autem in
morbum cadat, id etiam interiturum ,· dolere autem animos ,· ergo etiam
interire. The reasoning is weak‚ as proof based on analogy often is;
the pains of the mind are essentially different from those of the body.
Of course the argument becomes valid if one accepts the “ correlation
and equivalence” of physical, vital, and mental forceS‚ as stated,
eg„ by Herbert Spencer, ‘ First Prin.' 5 71 : but see Bowne, ‘ Phil. of
Herb. Spencer‚’ p. 90 et seq. Consult Maudsley ‘ Body and Mind,'
especially sect. 3 on the “ relation of morbid bodily' states to mental
functions.” 462. quoque: i.e.‚ of death as well as disease; with
esse supply eum. De La Mettrie makes this line the conclusion of his
‘ Histoire naturelle de l'ame,’ in which some of these arguments of
Lucr. and many others against the soul’s immortality‚ are set forth.
476. denique: see n. to 1, 199.—-quor: the older form of cur ,· as
o passed into u the preceding u was dropped and q became c ,· so

quom became cum, equos ecus etc. 479. tardescit: found only
here. 481. genere : see n. to 1, 160. 482. Observe the allitera·
tion3 see n. to 1, ¹4· 484. inque ped.: tmesis. 486. aevo:

‘ existence.’ 493. agens an. : ‘ while trying to drive forth his soul.’
— quasi . . . ferm: quasi in the sense of quam ad modum is not often
found immediately with the indic. as here3 usually the constr. is
elliptical. A. 3123 H. 513, ΙΙ. The indic. is more vivid. 494.
val. viribus: cf. 1, 971 3 451 above. 496. semina vocis: the ma
terial nature of sound is shown 4, 524 et seq. 498. munita viai:
see n. to 1, 86; munire was the technical term for mad-making.
Munro explains the line as qua consuerunt ferri et est illis munita via,
'a regularly made road.’ 500. seorsum: see n. to 286. 501.
veneno: i.e., vi morbi. 502. reflexit: neuter only here; desipien-
tia (499) is not found elsewhere. 504. consurgit: for subject
refer back to 488 aliquis. —omnis is of course acc. pl. 506.
haec: i.e.‚ animus et anima. 508—9: cf. 443-4. 510. mentem
sanari etc.: in antiquity there were no asylums for the insane, and
the unsound in mind had a hard lot. Some of the Greek physicians‚
however, made a study of mental diseaseS‚ and in a few things seem
to have anticipated modern discoveries. Strange as it may seem,
however, systematic investigation of insanity and the best methods
of treatment, dates only from the latter part of the last century. The
tendency of to-day is more and more to consider insanity a result of
purely physical causes. But the poet's argument here is worthless;
