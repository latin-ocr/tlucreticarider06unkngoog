the Mss. 315. strata viarum: see n. to 86. The phrase in-
cludes not merely the streets of citieS, but also the paved highwayS,
as the Via Appia. —proptert see n. to 90. 317. signa: statues
of the gods were often placed near the city gates to receive the wor-
ship of those who entered. See Pausanias 43 33, ξ 4. Thiscustom is
thought to explain the reference in Acts 14, 13 ὅ τε ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ
ὄντος πρὸ τῆς πόλεως, ταύρους καὶ πέμματα ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας ἐνέγκας,
σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις ἤθελεν θύειν. The Greeks appear to have touched or
kissed the chin of statueS, the Romans the right hand. A parallel to
the fact noticed by Lucr. may be seen in many European churches
and cathedraIS. The right· foot of the bronze statue of St. Peter in
St. Peter's at Rome is partly worn away by the kisses of devotees.
318. salutantum . . . meantum: hysteron proteron. For the spell-
ing see n. to 1, 4 animantum ; praeterque meantum, perhaps a tmesis3
but see n. ‘to 66 contra. 321. speeiem: = visum,· ‘the nature
of vision has jealously shut out our seeing! 322. dies: as in
233· 326. vesco: ‘ corroding.' Vescus, connected in derivation
with vescor (ve-ed-cO, vus-co, vesca, Vanicek, ‘ Etym. W6rtb.’ p. 28),
has lost the active sense except here and in a very few‘other pas·
Sages. See Munro’s note. 327. quoque: qubque, as above 320.
328. natura gerit: see n. to 56. The metaphor here, as Munro
remarks, is taken from the government of a state.

2. There is Void, in which Atorns move and
are acted on. 329-417.

There is void ( 329-334).‚ [f tlzere were not, motion would not be
possible ( 335-34 5). Besides, all things are penetrable{ admitting other
bodies into them or through them ( 346-357). Things qf the same size
dtjffer in wetjght ( 3 58-369).

329. stipata: ‘packed together’; a common word in Lucr. 330.
inane: a substantive, =rb κενόν, which was defined by Arist. (Phys,
4, 1, 6) as τόπος ἐστερημένος σώματος, ‘place devoid of body.' For
‘ void ’ Lucr. also has vacuum, once vacans in 444 inane vacansque.
He uses also spatium, locus, and the like, but less definitely, to desig-
nate the room or space in which things exist. 331. in mul. rebus:

‘in many respects.’ 333. summa rerum: here = the universe.-

334. This line is doubtless spurious. It was first rejected by Bent-
ley. 335. quod esset t i. e. inane existeret. 336. officium ε ⁴ property.‘
339. quoniam ι quantiam could not begin the line, ancl hence does not
