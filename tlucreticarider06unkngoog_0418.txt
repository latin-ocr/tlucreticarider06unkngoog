things different shapes of atoms are suited (see 1, 190-1 and ιι). In
speaking of the stars as living things, however, the poet was conform-
ing to the language of many of his philosophie predecessors and con-
temporaries as well as to that of common life3 for their divine nature
was deeply rooted in ancient thought. Anaximander and Anaximenes
seem to have considered the stars as created gods; the Pythagoreans
believed in their divinity; Plato and Aristotle taught that they are

. living, rational beings3 and the Stoics thought that they are permeated
i with the divine spirit, possessedof souls. 526. eorum: i.e.‚ear=um

here is exactly that of Epicurus, who in explaining natural phenomena
made it his principle to assign several causes, any one of which might
be true of this world, and all of which might operate in one or an-
other of the infinite number of worlds. Thus he declares that the
motion of the stars may be due to the movement of the entire heaven3
or that they may move while the heaven remains stationary‚ either
from an impulse given them when they were formed and continued by
their heat, or from the attraction of material suitable to their nature,

is interesting that recently a Frenchman (A. Blanqui‚ ‘ L’Eternite par
les Astres, Hypothese astronomique,' Paris, 1872) has carried out
again, quite seriously, the idea that everything possible is somewhere

· and at some time realized in the universe3 and, in fact, has often

been realized, and that too as an inevitable consequence, on the one

· hand, of the absolute infinity of the universe, but on the other of the
² finite and everywhere constant number of the elements whose possible
, combinations must also be finite.’' Cf. Lucr. 2, 480- 521.

any more than a man is burdened by his own limbs. 534- 563.
