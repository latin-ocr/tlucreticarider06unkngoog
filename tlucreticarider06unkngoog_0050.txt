chasm between dead matter and the highest organic existenceS.
With his mind full of the popular hylozoistic conceptions of his
time, the step from matter to life seemed to him natural and
easy. Modern Materialism sees the difficulty, and obscures but
does not remove it, by taking refuge in a slow process of devel-
opment. Indeed, it makes several unwarrantable assumptions
where Lucretius made one. The spontaneous origin of life is
yet unproved, with the probabilities against it from the failure
of repeated experiments to produce protoplasm. There are bar-
riers between types that have not been broken down, and that
are directly opposed to the present laws of reproduction. The
correlation of physica] and vital forces is as unproved to-day
as in the time of Lucretius. Assuming the doctrine of descent
to be true, the adaptation and harmony that run all through it
profoundly emphasize the conception of design in it. For that
cannot be taken out of matter which was not previously wrapt
up in it3 and unless an intelligent, directing Power be assumed
behind matter this orderly unfolding is absolutely unaccountable.
The chances are infinitely against it. The general similarity

- of types throughout the organic world points not so much to a

likeness that might have been impressed upon all living things
by being left as the wrack of countless ages of existence beat-
ing against the merciless rock-barriers of its environment‚ as to
a profound ‘⁴ economy of plan‚’' in accordance with which an
infinite Wisdom shaped the forms of life, like the crystaIS‚ so
that they stand to one another in a relation of marvellous har-
mony and beauty.

While the Materialism of our day is an outgrowth‚ in part,
of the predominant interest now given to the natural scienceS,
both from the enthusiasm of rapid advances in investigation
and from their wide-reaching practica] applicationS, and in part,
of the industrial and material trend of our civilization, the aim
it professes is not so much to aid the scientist as to furnish a
rule of duty. The foremost materialists have the same con-
tempt for religion that Lucretius had, though they are not so
vehement in their expression; and their philosophie purpose,
