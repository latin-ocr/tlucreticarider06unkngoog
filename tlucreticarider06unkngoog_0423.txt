708.] NOTES 361

Romans themselves sometimes identified Matuta with Leucothea, the
daughter of Cadmus. 664. dispersos etc.: edd. refer to Diod.
Siculus, 17, 36, where this phenomenon is described at length3 cf.
also Id. 3, 47. It was doubtless due to refraction. In sor'ne regions
the sun often appears of irregular shape. 669. certo etc.: the poet
here, as often, appeals to the observed fact of the uniformity of na-
ture and the regularity of natural processes. Cf. 1, 174 et seq. and n.

to 1, 586. 671. arbusta: see n. to 1, 187. 677. fuerunt: see
n. to 1, 406. 679. conseque: see nn. to 1, 215 and 560. Conse-
qic'e quoque iam redeunt is Lachmann's emend. for consequiae quoque
iam rerum. 681. luces: for dies, as often. 682. aut: the

coi-relatives are below, 696 and 701. —idemz ‘the same’ sun as
op'posed to the notiqn in 701-3 of a fresh sun every morning.
684. orbem: ‘orbit.’ 685 et seq. In running courses of un-
equal length above and below the earth, the sun adds just as much to
the one part as is taken from the other; the longer that part of his
course above the earth is, just so much the shorter that part below the
earth will be, and vice versa. The inequality will continue till the sun
reaches the equinoxes (anni nodus), at which the day and the night are
equal in length. 689. cursu ε for cursu solis.—flatus : gen. after
medio ‘ midway between.' 690. metas: usually explained as the
two tropics. Munro, with good reason, makes it refer to the points
where the sun rises and sets; ‘⁴ the heaven keeps his two goals at an
equal distance from north and south, i.e., speaking roughly the sun
rises and sets due east and west 3 '’ and this is so ‘ on account of the
position of the whole starry circle.’ 695. notarunt: ‘ mapped out.’
701. sic: i.e., ae're crassiore. 703. certa parte: “a particular
quarter, which varies every day throughout the year,” Munro ex-

plains. After 704 a verse has fallen out, Munro thinks, something ,

like qui fizciunt solis nova semper lumina gtgmk otherwise 704 is well-
nigh meaningless where it stands; Lachmann attaches it to 703, and
makes no change, but with extreme violence to the sense.

(6) 77ae moon may borrow its lega-ht from the sun, or shine with its own
leg-ht, or be made anew every day. 705—7 50.

707. speciem: ‘sight ’ς so 7243 4, 236 and 24²· 708. donique:
old form of donec, found also 723, 9973 2, 11163 donicum also is some-
times met with in the-older writers· See Neue, ‘ Formenlehre,’ ii. 805 ς
