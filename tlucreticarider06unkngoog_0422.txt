resistance of the air, or to the fact that being on fire they have need of
suitable matter, and that this gives out, or lastly to the fact that in the

(5) Negat comes either because the fires os the sun are burned out or
because it turns its course under the earth ( 6 50-5). Daysollows, when
the sun returns from under the earth to its course above, or because new
fires at a fixed time have gathered ; for many things huppen at regular
inter-vals (6 56-679). Days and nights vary in length either sor the rea—

The theory in 6 51-3 was held by Xenophanes and Heraclitus. On the

of a glassy nature, reflecting light and heat from the· central fire;
night comes when the earth is on the opposite side of the central fire
from the sun, and presents to it the side opposite to us. Similar was
the view of Empedocles, that the sun concentrates heat srom the
bright hemisphere which is over us by day. The other earlier physi-
cists for the most part made out that the sun is a fiery body or mass of
flames confined, and that night is caused by the dip of the sun in its
circular orbit under the earth. AnaximeneS, however, said that night

and dying out3 and in other ways they may be produced, as in the
cases previously mentioned, for the appearances manifest to the senses
in no way contradict this. They may happen, too, from the passing
of the heavenly bodies above and below the earth3 for this also is in
no wise inconsistent with appearances.’ 655. orbern: the sun’s
