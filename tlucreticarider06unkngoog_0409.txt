sd quod nostri caelum memorant, Grai perhibent aethera:

quidquid est boc, omnia animat, format, alit, auget, creat,

sepelit recipitque in sese omnia, omniumque idem est pater,
indidemque eadem quae oriuntur, de integro aeque eodem decidunt.

which it is thought Luer. followed. 323. deminui : i.e.‚ cum res
auget alitque. With the thought of 322-3, cf. 3, 517-8.

5. Had tlte world, existed from eternity‚ the poets would sing· of deeds
back far beyond tlze tales os Thebes and Troy. Dost think that, though
tlte world llas always been, beat, earthquakes, or floods destroyed tlte race
of men ἕ T hen much the more is the world proved mortal ,· sor a
more potent cause might have wrecked the world itselfi 324-3 50.

326. supera: see n. to 1, 429. —funera Troiaet see n. to 1, 464.
330. summa: i.e.‚ haec summa rerum, synonymous with mundi. See
n. to 1, 235. 332-5. Guyau finds in Lucr. the poet of progress3
cf. ‘Morale d'Epicure et ses rapports avec les doctrines contempo-
raineS,' p. 159: ⁶ Without doubt already there have been found in
Lucretius a large number of modern ideas, as those of evolution and

- of natural selection3 but that of human progress, moral, intellectual‚

and industria] progress, which he has so clearly expressed, has up to
the present hardly been noticed. Still, the fifth book of Lucretius has
the most striking analogy with the ‘⁸ Esquisse des progres de l’esprit
humain,’' drawn in our day by Condorcet.' 336. curn primis:
see n. to 1, 130. 336-7. Previous to Lucr.‚ however, C. Ama-
finius had treated in bad prose the physical doctrines of Epicurus;
Zeller from Cic. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3, 6 fixes his date “ not long after the
philosophie embassy of 156 Β. c.'’ Cf. Cic. Acad. 1, 2, 5 vides autem ·

bita de rebus ante oculos positis volgari sermone disputant ‚' nihil definiunt,
nihil partiuntur, nihil apta interrogatione concludunt, nullam denique
artem esse nec dicendi nec dtkserendi putant. Perhaps it was on ac-
count of their style that Lucr. passes over in contempt the services of
Amafinius and Rabirius (or Rabinus) in popularizing the Epicurean
philosophy; at any rate, their books were much read, as is evident
from Cic. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3, 6 cuius (Amafinii) libris editis commota mul-
titudo contulit se ad eam potis-simum disciplinam, sive quod erat cognitu
