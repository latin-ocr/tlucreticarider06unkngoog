lii INTRODUCTION

In his collocation of words Lucretius sometimes shows a
striving after effect. The fondness for alliteration and asso-
nance, so common among the early Latin writers, is displayed in
no small degree. Yet the ear does not sate with the results of
it; often his arrangements of wordS‚ especially in the adaptation
of verse-movement to sense, are peculiar and highly effective.
The versification of Lucretius is a vast improvement upon that
of Ennius in regularity and ease of movement. There is a ten-
dency toward the monotonous3 but it is always a monotony
suggestive rather of majestic flow than insipid rippling. Its
rhythm is on the whole more pleasant to the ear than that of
Horace's hexameterS‚ though it lacks the subtle variety and
artistic finish of Vergil’S. As a philosopher Lucretius was
surpassed by no Roman in the power of grasping a system of
thought, or in cogency of reasoning3 as a poet he was un-
· equalled by any Roman in originality and power of expression.
The De Rerum Natura is hy many regarded, not unjustly, as
the greatest didactic poem of all literature.
