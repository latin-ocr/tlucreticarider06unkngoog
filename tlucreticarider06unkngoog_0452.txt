Latin Selections

Specimens of the Latin Language and Lsterature, from the Earliest
Times to the End of the Classical Period. Edited by Enmunn H.
SM1TH3 revised by Professor WILLARD K. (ἶιΕΜεΝΤ, University of

Idaho. 12mo, eloth, 446 pages. Price, βι5ο.

EGINNING with the Song of the Arval Brothers, and
fragments from the Laws of the Kings and of the Twelve
Tables, these Selections illustrate Latin Literature down to the
time of BoethiuS. More than 130 authors are represented, and
no name of any reputation is wanting. No such condensed and
complete view of Latin literature can be found in any other
publication.
The text of this revised edition has everywhere been carefully
compared with that of a standard critical edition, and may be
considered as authoritative.

Professor Tracy Fecit, Yale College .· The plan seems to me to be carried
out with excellent J‘udgment and taste. This work certainly gives, in suc-
cinet and attractive form, a clear view of Roman literature throughout
its best periodS.
