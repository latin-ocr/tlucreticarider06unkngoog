xxxviii INTRODUCTION

acquiesce in the absolute authority os the Greek philosophy,
though their minds were not inventive enough to establish a
rival by its side.''¹ Lucretius ought not to be considered a ser-
vile imitator of Epicurus. The doctrines which he accepted he
ardently believed in; and he fully assimilated them in both
their general range and minor details. When, therefore, for the
sake of his countrymen he began to expound them, they came
forth glowing from the depths of his beart and soul, and bore
not simply an individual but a distinctively Roman stamp. No
work of the entire literature shows more clearly the bent of the
national character. The earnestness of purpose, the freedom
from quibbling or sophistry and the straightforward grappling
with leading questionS‚ the emphasizing of the simpler modes
of life and the homelier virtueS, the stern and solemn, even
gloomy view of existence,—all point to traits not merely of the
man but also of the nation.

The poem also indicates clearly the tendencies of the age.
It is a protest against the degrading i nfluences of impure super-
stitions3 against the sharn and increasing degeneracy of society3
against the reckleSS, mad ambitions and ceaseless ferment of
political life. In a period grossly material in tastes and enjoy-
mentS, when great fortunes were being rapidly made and were
ever bringing new luxuries in their train, it bids men take refuge
and find true happiness in higher things, in pleasures of the
soul rather than the body. The mission of Lucretius was to set
forth the atomic Materialism as it appeared acceptable to the
Roman mind and adapted to meet the needs of the Roman
character for a philosophy of life and rule of duty. Just so it
was the mission of Seneca to expound Pantheism to his country-
men3 and in the almost religious fervor of his utterances about
virtue and right living there is manifested the same spirit that
stirred our poet.

The influence of Lucretius' poem as a philosophie work can-
not be easily traced or readily estimated. The Latin writers of
