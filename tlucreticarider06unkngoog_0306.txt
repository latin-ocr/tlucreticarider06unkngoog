528 plagis. 223. inania == inania loca. All things were supposed
to contain void, as only the atoms were thought to be perfectly solid.
See 483 et seq. 224. nullius: i.e. nullius rei. —videri: Munro
notes that videri here has the force of esse, as in Greek φαίνεσθαι is
often used for εἶναι.

(2) Infim'te past time must have reduced all things to nought.
22 5-237. ·

228. redducit: in texts of classical writers generally written re-
ducit. But red was the primitive form of the particle re, in its origin
an abl. case; so in early Latin compounds either have the fun form
red, or lengthen the vowel to compensate for the loss of d,· thus
redducere, reccidere (always in ‘Lucr.) or reducere, rict'dere. Later the d
was dropped without compensation. See Roby 160, 6 and 7. 230.
mare: obj. of suppeditant, which is here used transitively. —ingen-
uei: -ei is an old ending of the nom. pl. of astems‚ common during the
second century Β. c., and occurring occasionally till the Augustan age.
Munro takes ingenuei as opposed to externa=‘its own native . . .
from without.’ 231. unde aeth. sid. pas: suggestive of Verg.
Aen. 1, 608 polus dum sidera pascit. cf. 10343 see 5, 523-5 and n.
232. debet: for necesse est, to indicate a necessary result or conse-
quence; trans. ‘must.' Osten thus in Lucr.; ὀί. 2, ιί2ο; 3, 187 etc.
233. consumpse: archaic,= consumpsisse‚· both forms were origi·
nally sigmatic aorists‚ ending ·se. In the older poets the shorter
form is not uncommon with stems ending in s, ss or x‚· it is occa-
sionally met with in the later writers, Cf. 3, 650 abstraxe ,· 5, 1159
protraxe,· Hor. Sat. ι, 9, 73. For other examples see Neue, ‘ For-
menlehre,' ii. 535-8.—anteacta: pronounced as a trisyllable, an-
tffictcu the parts are written separately 2, 298. Lucr. is fond of this.
word—dies: ‘time,’ ‘lapse of days.’ Cf. 322, 557. 234. fuere:
supply res or elementa. 235. haec rerum . . .summa: i.e. the
world, as distinguished from summa rerum, the universe. 236.
certe: emphatic by position, ‘beyond doubt.' 237. The form of
the reasoning is worthy of note. An inference of fact introduced by
{gitur follows a conditional sentence. Some modern materialists build
gigantic fabrics of certain knowledge upon an 1F.

(3) T ke same cause would avail to destroy all things. 238-249.

238. denique ‚z as in 199.-volgo: ‘without distinction.’ 240.
