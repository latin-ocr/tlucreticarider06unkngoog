Plato, and others. Cf. 3, 670 et seq. and nn. 114. This' line is to
be taken in connection with nata'sit as embodying the poet’s view.

This line and 113 were perhaps suggested by the verses of Ennius
(preserved by Varro, L. L. 5, 593 Vahlen’s edit. Ann. 10—13)= —

ova parire solet genus pinnis condecoratam
non animam ; et post inde venit divinitus pullis

For the thought of 1 16 cf. Tennyson, ‘ Two Voices ’2'—

“ It may be that no life is found,
Which only to one engine bound
Faus off, but cycles always round.”

117. Ennius ε Q. Ennius (b. 239 13.c. at Rudiae in Calabria, d. 169)
was “in letters what Scipio was in action, the most vital representa·
tive of his epoch. It was to him, not to Naevius or Plautus, that the
Romans looked as the father of their literature.” Of his writings only
fragments remain. The most important was the Amiales, the first great

looked to Ennius as his master in verse, and shows in many passages
traces of his influence. Vergil likewise and others found in Ennius,
if not a model, at least a poet of whom many verses could be with
fitness transferred and imitated. Ennius was a Pythagorean. He
boasted, it is said, that the soul of Homer, having passed through
many bodies, among which in particular was that of a peacock, had
come into his own. With this in mind Horace calls him alter Ho-
merus, though there is reference also to the Homeric flow of his epic
verse; see Hor. Ep. 2, 1, 50 and Macleane’s note. In the Pytlfago·
rean view of metempsychosis the passing of souls through the bodies

satirized by Lucian in the ‘ Cock.' The best account of Ennius is
in Prof. Sellar’s ‘ Roman Poets of the RepubliC,’ ch. 4. 118. Heli-
