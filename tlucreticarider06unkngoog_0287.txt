Greek poetS, who represented him as armed with arrows and torches.
See TheocrituS‚ Id. 23, and- cf. Ov. Trist. 5, 1, 22. 35. cervice:
i.e. Martis. —repostaz for reposita, ‘ thrown back.' It has been con-
jectured that in this description the poet had in mind some painting‚
perhaps one of those that formed part of the decoration of temples.
36. visus: for oculos. 37. Order of trans. et spiritus (illius) re-
supini pendet ex tuo ore. 38. hunc: governed by circum in cir-
cumficsa ; super is used adverbially: ‘shed thyself about him and
above.' 39. loquellas: the suffix -Z’la is in good MSS. written -ella
when the preceding syllable is short. Thus lb'quella, querella is a better
spelling than loquela, querela( commonly given in the dictionaries.
On the other hand, we should write ίᾶίὲῖα, suadela. See Roby‚ 177, 23
Lachmann, n. to Lucr. 3, 1015. 40· incluta: ‘glorious’; an epi-
thet rarely applied to a divine being. Lucr. uses it also with refer-
ence to Epicurus (3, 10) and Memmius (5, 8).

41-43. Various conjectures have been made regarding the time to
which these lines refer. That of 'Munro is the most likely to be
correct; he thinks “ that Lucr. was writing these lines towards the
close of 695, or four years before his death, when Caesar was consul,
and had formed his coalition with Pompey. Memmius was then
praetor designatuS, in fierce opposition to Caesar, and at that time
on the side of the Senate with Cicer0, and doubtless LucretiuS.
There was almost a reign of terror.'’ 41. hoc: interpret from
ll. 24—5. 42. Memmi: for the form see n. on 11 favoni.
43. desse: = deesse ,· e -f— e is often conti-acted to ἒ. 80 in syn-
copated perfectS, as dele‘runt for deleverunt, deleerunt. So generally
derat, dest for deerat, deest. Cf. 1, 711, derrasse for deerrasse. In 3,

ὓ 86ῐ deerrarunt both vowels are retained, but are scanned as one.
44-49. The six lines printed here in the old editions = 2, 646-651. ²

Isaac Vossius was the first to notice that they were inserted here to
show the inconsistency of the poet in addressing a divinity at the
beginning of the work in which he maintains that ‘every nature of
the gods must in itself of necessity enjoy immortality in deepest peace,
far removed and withdrawn from concerns of ours ; for free from
every pain, from dangers free, powerful in its own resourceS‚ in noth·
ing needful of uS, it is neither won over by favors nor stirred by
anger.’ Lachmann and Munro agree that after 43 a few lines have
been lost that furnished the transition to what follows. In them Mem-
mius must have been addressed.
