Once, it is said, fire prevailed‚ and once water ; the like may huppen again
with destruction more far-reaching. 380—415.

381. membra: four members are mentioned 235-63 but the poet
here speaks only of the strife between fire and wate'r. In the last
paragraph the externa] causes of destruction were discussed ; he now
takes up the causes that may lurk within the world itself. —- pio ne-
quaquam: because of their relationship. 382. ollis: see n. to

· 1, 67'2. 383. vel cum ete.: another vel would be expected, as

Munro observeS, to complete the constr. 3 but at 386 the poet gives a
different turn to the thought, and changes the form of the sentence.
Instances of a like change of constr. are not uncommon. With this
strife between fire and water Lambinus compares the famous θεῶν
μάχη, οι· contest between Apollo and Neptune, in Homer. Anaximan· 1
der held that the sea would sometime dry up; this must lead to the Ι
burning up of the earth, as the elements of heat and fire would then
preponderate. Heraclitus taught that the present order of things
would come to an end in a great conflagration 3 see n. to 1, 638. Cer·
tain of the Stoics believed that the world is sometimes destroyed by
fire and sometimes by floodS, a new world always coming into exist-
ence after a fixed period. To the last point Boethius made the apt “,
objection that if the world burned up, the fire aster a time must needs
go out for lack of fuel, and there would be nothing left to make a new Ξ
world out of. XenophaneS, τοο, seems to have taught the periodical .

397. PliaEthonta: the poet interprets the myth of Pha'e'ton after the
manner of the StoicS,supposing it to have a basis of fact in some vast
and destructive conflagration. For a similar explanation of the story
see Keightley’s ‘ Mythology.' Lambinus compares Plato’s interpretaq
tion Tim. 22 c: ‘ Now this has the form of a myth, but really signi-
fies a declination of the bodies moving around the earth and in the ‚
heavens‚ and a great conflagration of things upon the earth recurring '
at long intervals of time; when this happenS, those who live upon the “
mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction
