3. Nor is matter made up of a number of homo-
geneous primitive elements. 830—920. ·

The view of Anaxagoras, also, is open to objections: first, in that it
assumes an indefinite number of primitive elementi, and denies the
existence qs void or qs any limit to the dioin‘bdity of matter. 8 30-846.

830. Anaxagorae z b. at Clazomenae, about 500 Re. Anax·
agoras taught that there is an indefinite number of primitive sub-
stanceS, qualitatively different. corresponding to all the various kinds
of matter. ThuS, flesh is made up of minute particles of ssesh, bone
of particles of bone, gold of gold, and so forth. These particles are
underived and indestructible. They are not, however, atomS‚ for they
are infinitely divisible. The four elements he thought to be merely a
mixture of all kinds of primitive particles3 their “apparent simple-
ness he explains by saying that, on account of the amalgamation οἱ
all possible determinate substanceS, not one of these is perceived in
its distinctive individuality, but only that is perceived in which they
all agree.” To explain the union of these in living bodies, and the
creation and on-going of the universe, Anaxagoras taught the exist·
enee of a Νοῦς, an incorporeal, intelligent Force, acting upon matter
{rom without. He was the first who grasped at the idea of essential
difference between matter and spirit; at the conception also of an
intelligent Final Cause. It is an error, however, to suppose that
Anaxagoras believed in the Νοῦς as a personality, as an infinite, all·
perfect God. See Zeller, ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil.’ vol. ii. — homoeomerian e
Ξὸμοιομέρειαν, and so written in some MSS. and older edit. ; ‘ homoeo-
meria.’ Anax. called his primitive particles σπέρματα ‘seeds ’ or χρή-
ματα ‘things '; ὁμοιομερῆ ‘of like parts' does not occur iu the frag·
ments of Anax. extant, but is first found in Aristotle; whether it or
ὁμοιομέρεια was used by Anax. is an open question. The latter term
is first met with in this passage, and seems to denote “the relation
which existed between the things in being and the particles,'like in
kind, of which they were composed,” as suggesting the doctrine of
simple substances composed of parts infinitely small. In later Greek
writers αἱ ὁμοιομέρειαι is used in describing the system of Anax„ as by
Diog. Laert. 2, 8 οὗτος ἔλεγε ἀρχὰς δὲ τὰς ὁμοιομερείας·
καθάπερ γὰρ ἐκ τῶν ψυγμάτων λεγομένων τὸ χρυσὸν συνεστάναι, οὕτω,
