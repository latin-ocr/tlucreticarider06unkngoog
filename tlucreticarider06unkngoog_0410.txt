3, 592 et seq. to show that the soul perishes with the body; cf. espe-
cially 346—7 with 3, 602. 345. periclis: E13icurus held that all
the innumerable worlds would be destroyed, some in one way, some
ἰιι another. Cf. Diog. Laert. 10, 73 ‘All (the worlds) must be‘ again
dissolved‚ some more rapidly, some more slowly, and some from
one cause, some from another.’ Cf. Plut. Plac. 2, 4. 350. atque ι

by blows, or must not be exposed to blows‚ or must have no surrounding
void into which it can be dissolved. T he world meets none of these condi·

between the worlds (μετάξὺ κόσμων διάστημα, οι· μετακόσμιον) was
not absolutely void, but contained more or less stray matter. See
Diog. Laert. 10, 89. How his gods managed to pass an undisturbed
and ever-blessed existence there, it {s hard to imagine. 373. leti
