Spencer's Formula of Evolution.' 1000. inferna: ‘from be·
neath,' as Mum-0 explains, implying “every kind of motion upwardS,
whether perpendicularly or obliquely upwards, all of which would
have more or less sustaining power in opposition to the inherent
downward tendency.” 1001. ex infinito: here refers to space3
below 1025 to time. 1004. Found also 5, 1216. 1006. copia:
i.e., of space.

3. Matter is infinite in quantity. 1008—1051.

Space being infinite in extent, matter is infinite in quantity ; otherwise
things could never have been formed, or even if produced could not con·
tinue in existence. 1008-1051.

1008. 101. sum.: i.e.‚ the universe. For the thought ef. Epicurus
in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 41-2. ‘ The universe is infinite as regards both
the quantity of bodies and the extent of space. For if space were in-
finite, but bodies of limited number, bodies would nowhere be at rest,
but would be borne on and scattered throughout the infinite space,
from the lack of anything to sustain them or keep them in place by
resistance. But if space were finite and bodies of infinite number, the
bodies infinite in number would not have room in which to exist!
1012-3. The best authorities agree that there is a lacuna here.
Lachmann supposes it to be after 10123 Munro places it after 1013,
and thus bridges over the transition from the alternation of matter and
void to the infinity ot* matter :—

sed spatium supra docui sine fine patere ;
si finita igitur summa esset materiai,
uec mare etc.

[⁴ But void I have already proved to be infinite; therefore, matter
must be infinite; for if void were infinite and matter finite] neither

sea nor earth nor the glittering quarters of heaven ’ etc. 1015.
sancta: the word well suits the Epicurean conception of the physi-

cal nature of the gods. ef. Cic. N. D. 1, 17, 45. 1021 et seq. The
