328 LUCRETms [111. 894-

894-6. Cf. the stanza of Gray’s ‘ Elegy' ε -

“ For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care}-
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb liis· knees, the envied kias to share.”

Edd. here compare also Georg. 2, 523-4 Interea dulces pendent circum
oscula nati ‚· Casta pudicitiam servat domus. 896. praeripere ε the
infinitive, expressing purpose, is sometimes found after a verb of mo-
tion in Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius, and rarely in the Augustan
poetS. 897. factis flor-‚2 ‘ prosperous doings.' 898. misero·
misere: misero is drawn from its natural position near tibi, for the
sake of the assonance, of which Lucr. is so fond. Cf. nn. to 666, 779.

ἱ 899. dies: i.e., mortis. 900. illud: see n. to 1,8o. 906. cinefac-

tum: ‘ turned to ashes ’ according to Nonius, a signification which Lach—
mann decides cannot be correct. Munro renders ‘ turn to an ashen
hue '3 the meaning seems to be that the bereaved stood weeping near
the funeral pyre and gazed on the body as it was gradually consumed,
taking on the color of -ashes2—-bustoz the funeral pyre; connected
with com-bu-rp. Bustum, says Festus, proprie dicitur Iocus in quo
mortuus est combustus et sepultus. 908. dies: see n. to 1, 233.
909. hoc: the weeping relative or friend who has just spoken. —

amari z from amarus.

(5) Men at their cups cry out, ‘ brief is this plens-ure, enjoy it ere it
goes beyond recall '‚· as if thirst or any desire could fhllow them in death.
In sleep there is no thought qfself or lfiv' so even more in death, in which
there is a more thorough scattering of tlte matter qf us. 912—930.

912. discubuere: i.e.,in conviviale. 913. inum. orae chaplets of
leaves and flowers were worn at the drinking-bouts as an antidote
against intoxication3 ora, ‘ brows! 914. homullis: with the
diminutive is associated the idea of ‘ insignificant,’‘ of no account.’
The thought is, ‘enjoyment is brief, hence take advantage of it ’; like
“ eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die,'’ the motto of most
Epicureans. This doctrine LucretiuS, true to the old Roman philos·

· ophy of life, visits wi'th stern censure. Herein he stands in marked

contrast with Horace, who would fill each day with pleasure; see Od.
1, 9 and 11 ; 3, 29 etc. ; Martha ‘ Lucrece,' p. 159 etseq. ; also Munro’s
n. 915. iam fuerit: ‘ presently it will have been.' 916. cum
