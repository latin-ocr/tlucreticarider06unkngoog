failure to notice this distinction involved the ideas of most of the
ancients about time and space in utter confusion: and, in fact, the
subject is even now not entirely cleared up. 464. Tyndaridem:
Helen. The poet proceeds to show that all things of history are
accidents of matter and void. The causeS, characterS, sceneS‚ and
incidents of the Trojan War formed a body os stock illustrations,
which was drawn upon for the most different uses by both Greek and
Latin writerS. To the Romans allusions to the Trojan War seem to

of the Stoics were very confused regarding both time and space.

other.’—Teucris: Munro’s emend. for terri-u Lachm. has per sest,

a much less probable reading. 474. Alexandri: PariS, while a

shepherd on Mt. Ida, having shown great courage in protecting the

flocks and his companions, received the name Alexander (ἀλέξ-ανδρος.

‘defending men’). By this name he is usually designated in the

Iliad. 475. clara: in this word Munro sees a play on the two mean-

ings' of clarus, ‘famous in story,’ and ‘bright,’ in reference to the
flames of war. 476. clam ε prep. with Troiianis ,· rarely used
with the abl.; see Roby, 1877. It may be that clam is an adv. and
Troii. a dat. of disadvantage. -— durateus: transferred from the Greek
δουράτεος ‘wooden,' and used only of the horse before Troy. Cf.
Hom. Od. 8, 493 and 51²· 477. equos: earlier spelling of equus .-
ecus is also found in Lucr. 480. cluere: as in 449. 482. loci g
