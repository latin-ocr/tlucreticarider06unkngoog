xxxii INTRODUCTION

with thought fixed on the order and regularity manifest on every
hand, such a doctrine of natural causes seemed mean and low
enough. So not seeing that behind law there must be a law-
giver, he stopped with the conception of law itself. This satis-
fied the groping of his mind for a unifying principle that should
explain the myster-ies of natural phenomena. To it he con-
stantly appeals in setting forth causeS. By means of it he
accounts for the regularity of the seasons,¹ the alternation of
day and night‚·2 and manifold other things in which a certain
order is clearly to be seen. Yet Lucretius was no fatalist. He
spurns the old law of necessity to which the Atomists appealed.
By the swerving of the atoms as they fall in space, the eternal
chain of cause and effect is broken3 momentous results follow.⁸
Herein he is justly charged with inconsistency. He tried to
pursue a middle' course between inexorable fate and chaotic
polytheism. He found the beginning of a world in a fortuitous
swirl of atoms brought about by the unreflective sels-movement
of some atoms out of their course. But the atoms were moving
*straight downwardS‚ because the law of nature causes bodies to
sall unless hindered. They settled to different places for the
same reason. Thus in accordance with natural law the world
was evolved, its changes go on, its end is fixed. F ixed barriers
too hem in organic existence with the invariability of types and
the survival of the fittest. In the presence of the laws of nature
even man stands absolutely powerless; sometimes they seem a
hidden force dashing to nought his mightiest workS, foiling his
most gigantic efforts.⁴ T hus to Lucretius there seemed but
one break in the causal relations of the universe. This ex-
cepted, he held consistently and emphatically to the reign of law.
Nature as the incarnation of law, as the tangible reality through
which its operations are manifest, in his thought took on the
attributes of personality3 seemed a veritable being energizing
upon matter in space and time, directing the processes of pro-
