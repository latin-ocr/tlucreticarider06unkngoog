cursus= depends on viam,- pleonastic. 716. volvier: see n. to
1, 207. ’ 717. corpus ete.: on the supposition that the moon
shines with its own light, the complete or partial withdrawal of its
brightness at times may be accounted for in two ways: either a dark
body in a regular course through the heavens partly or entirely hides
it from us (717-9); or it may be bright only on one side, and, being
sphefical, in the course of its revolutions may present to us first the
light and then the dark side, with varying phases (720-7 30). 720.

campartem, of course, refers to'the bright side of the moon. 726.
glomer. atque pilai: = globus pilai above. 727. Chaldaeum:
see n. to 1, 1 divom ,· it depends, of course, on doctrina. Berosus of
Babylon (lived in the first half of the third century B.c.) and his fol-
lowers taught that the moon is a sphere, half bright and half dark.
728. astrologorum: not ‘ astrologerS‚' but ‘ astronomerS,‘ though both
significations are met with in classical writers. The reference is to
those who held that the moon's light is derived from the sun, as most
of the Greeks who did not personify the sun and moon taught.
This view is said to have been first set forth by Anaximenes (see Zel-
ler, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil! i. 27 5 for ref. to original authorities) 3 the
Pythagoream, however, believed that the moon, like the sun, is a

’ glassy sphere, which reflects light and heat back to the earth from the

central fire; Anaxagoras and Democritus agreed that both sun and
moon are bodies of earthy nature, heated by the motion of the sky;
and Xenophanes said that the moon burna out and is kindled afresh.
This last view has been attributed to Heraclitus also, but on insuffi-
cient authority.—contra: as in 1, 66 where see n.; here for con·

731 et seq. cf. the same argument regarding the sun, 660-679. To
this last view the poet himself most inclines; it is, in fact, the most
consistent with his system. With the alternatives proposed here by
Lucr. cf. Epicurus, Diog. Laert. 10, 94-5: ‘ The waxings and waning
of the moon may be caused by its revolutions, or by the different
