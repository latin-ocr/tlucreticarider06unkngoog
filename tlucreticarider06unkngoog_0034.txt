fuel at fixed times.1 Thunder is produced by the collision of
cloudS‚ or by the bursting of clouds from pent-up wind, or the
blowing of the wind violently through them, or the conflict of
inharmonious elements in them. F lashes of lightning are seen
when the clouds for some reason have struck forth seeds of fire.
Thunderbolts are forged by the wind compressing the cloudS,
and forcing the elements of heat into a fiery mass3 this falls
with so great violence partly because of the impulse given it by
the condensed cloud driving it forth, partly by reason of its own
weight and the exceeding fineness of the particles of which it is
composed.² Water-spouts are made by the confinement of wind
in a cloud, when the power of the blast‚ not being sufficient to
burst it, forces it down to the surface of sea or land.⁸ Volca-
noes are formed when the wind, imprisoned in vast earth-cavam,
by its pressure melts portions of rock‚ and forces forth the mol-

ten mass, together with much sand brought in its way by under-
ground channels from the sea.4 The violence of these windS‚

and sometimes the falling in of the cavern τοοὲε, are causes of
earthquakes.⁵ The alternate warmth and coolness in some
wells and hot springs may be explained by the shifting of parti-
cles of heat from earth to water, or from water to earth, with the
alternate contraction and expansion of the earth by day and by
night or at different seasons.⁶ The power of the magnet results
from this: that the atoms in it by their blows continually force
the air away from it on every side3 into the vacuum thus pro-
duced rush all other bodies not for some reason held back.⁷
Disease and pestilence have their origin in the tainting of the
air by elements baneful to life.⁸ In this way purely natural
causes can be assigned for everything that happenS. If it were
not for the groundless fears that burden the souls of men there
would be uo need of studying the processes of nature.⁹
