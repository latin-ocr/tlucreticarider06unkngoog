316 LUCRETIUS [ΙΙΙ. 553-

esse : =existere. 553. licuntur: see n. to 476 quor ,· generally
spelled liquuntur. 555. vas: see n. to 440 ; quod is of course
the pron., and illius refers to animus. 556. ei: also refers to

animus ; ⁶ or anything else you may prefer to imagine more intimately
(i ..e than a vessel) connected with it.’

The three following arguments are properly one; they
are given separately for convenience.

(10) Body and soul can exist only in union· ‚ neither can continue in
life without the other. Therefore when the body dies the soul also must

perish. 5 58- 57 5.
“ (1 1) Even when one still lives sometimes from a shock the so'ul is all
but dtlssolved ; a weigrhtier cause-would have destroyed it. 576— 586.

(12) Outside the body, the soul being exposed and helpless could not
exist a single moment of time, to say nothing of eternity. 587- 594.

558. viv. potestas: cf. 4093 1, 72 and n. 559. valent: in the pl.
because vivata potestas is understood with corporis ‚· coniuncta is neut.
pl. 560 et seq. For the argument cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24,
65-6 ‘The rest of -the body, remaining either as a whole or in part,
does not retain its feeling after the dispersion of. that combination of
atomS, whatever it may be, that forms the soul. Moreover, when the
whole body is dissolved the soul is dispersed, and no longer has
the same powers nor motionS, so that it no longer has feeling. For
it is inconceivable that the soul possesses feeling when not having
those wonted motions in that organic system (formed by itself in
union with the body), when its environment and surroundings are
not such that in their midst it can retain those motions’3 aISO, the
⁶ Systeme de la Nature,’ Part 1, ch. 13: “ Indeed, by what reasoning
will it be proved that the soul, which cannot feel, think, will or act
but by aid of man’s organs, can suffer pain, be susceptible to pleasure,
or even have a consciousness of its own existence, when the organs
that should warn it of their presence are decomposed or destroyed ? ’'
564. scorsum: used as a prep. with the abl. in the sense of se, sine
(deriv. fr. semorsus, ,se-vortere, old form of vertere) — the only passage
where this constr. is found. See Roby. 2110. 565. posse: see n.

, to 1, 586. 569. moventur: reflexive, taking motus as Greek acc.;

so quos . . . moveri below3 cf. Hor. Ep. 2, 2, 12 5 qui, mmc Satyrum,
