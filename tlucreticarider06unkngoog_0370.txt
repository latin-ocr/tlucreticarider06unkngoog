308 LUCRETIUS [III. 337-

the body, imparting to it this power, receives the same (μετείληφε τοι·
ούτου συμπτώματος) from it: but the body does not have all the states
which the soul has.’ 337-8 De la Mettrie in his ‘ Histoire natu-
relle de l'ame ’ maintains exactly this view, that body and soul are
formed together and together perish ; so all thorough-going material-
ists, who are consistent, must believe. 339. vaporem : not ‘ vapour ’ς
see n. to 1, 491 343. conque putr.: tmesis. 344 et seq. Cf. '
5 58-579 and nn. 348. quoniam etc. : ‘ since the cause of existence
lies in their joint action,’ as Munro puts it.

It is an error to suppose that sensation is due entirely to the soul. Yet
without soul the body has no sensation ,· because sensation is only an acci-
}lent, not an essential property. 350·8.

350. quod sup. ε see n. to 1, 50. 352. sensum: ‘sensation ’ does
not express the full meaning of the word 3 it signifies rather ‘ capacity
of feeling ’; ‘sense ’ is ambiguous. 353. manifestas: see n. to 1, 855.
354. sit: the subject is corpus sentire ,· the quid-clause stands as obj. ,
to adferet. 355. si . . res: ‘ except that which the plain fact of *the
case.’ 356-7. Cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 24, 64—65, where
this doctrine is more fully set forth. 357. proprium ε i.e., com‘unc-
tum ‘ essential property '; see n. to 1, 451. — aevo ε = vita ,· cf. n. to 1,
549. 358. perd. qu. exp. a. z Munro's reading for perditum expel-
litur aevo quam, which is manifestly wrong. Bernays rejects the verse,
Creech condemns it, and Lachmann, with harsh constr., reads nul·
laque praet'erea perdit, quom expellitur aevo. — expellitur: for subject
refer back to animd in 3 563 multa stands as obj. to perdit ,· quam . . .
ante of course for antequam.

Agrain, it is wrong to say that the eves themselves do not see, but that
the mind looks through them as through open doors. For {f this were
true, the eyes would not be dazzled and hindered from seeing by brzjght
lights ,· ond, moreover, the mind ought to be able to see better with the eyes
entirely taken away. 3 59-369.

359. Dicere . . diffic.·: strictly speaking, an inaccuracy, though a
common one3 the thing is not hard to say, but hard to believe or prove.
For the doctrine cf. Cic. Tusc. Disp. 1. 20, 46 Nos enim ne nunc qui-
dem oculis cernimus ea, quae videmus ‚· neque est enim ullus sensus in
corpore, sed ut non physici solum docent verum etiam medici qui ism
