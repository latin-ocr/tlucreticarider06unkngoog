nism of the universe was the productiori and on·g0in g of life. Whence
its origin? In a fortuitous combinatioh of atoms, indeed. Yet was
it not a part of the great system of law? Unconsciously, perhapS‚
poet-philosopher as he was, Lucretius came to see in nature a myste-
rious, e1usive, but all-pervading principle, almost a personality, that
presided over being. Before the majesty of this generative power
he paused in awe. For him its range and sweep were sea and earth
and sky, wherever living thing might be. Spring was the glad sea-
son of its quickening* advent, and all nature owned its genial sway
(see 1. 21). This principle, all-pervasive, all-persuasive, the poet in-
vokes under the name of Venus,—not as an empty form of words,
nor to get aid from it as a divine personality, but by rapt contem-
plation of its power to draw inspiration for his theme. In all this,
however, with true poetic skill he does· not present us with abstrae-
tions. With the address to Venus he, interweaves mythologie con-
ceptions that had their centre in her. Thus he addresses her as
‘ ancestress of the RomanS,’—a phrase to tiekle the ears of his fellow-
countrymen. He pietures her as bringing the War-god under her
control, and bids her keep him from the fray3 and touches here and
there reveal to us Venus as goddess of love. In exalting Venus,
moreover, he pays honor to the Memmii, of whom she seems to have
been the patron goddess; their coins bear image of her (see Munr0,
‘ Lucretius,’ 3d ed. i. 328). Thus with the poetic spirit deeply stirred
within him, the poet has skilfully wrought into combination a grand
philosophie idea and conceptions which would enlist the interest and
sympathetic attention of his readerS‚ particularly MemmiuS, to whom
the poem was addressed. This invocation to Venus is translated by
Pryden in a spirited version (Aldine ed. of Dryden, iii. 145). It is
imitated by Spenser, ‘Faerie Queene,' Bk. 4, Canto 10, st. 44—47.

volved in the meaning of the word here, as Venus is the-universal
life principle. Concelebrare first meant ‘to crowd,’ ‘to cause' a
place ‘to throng’ with beings; then ‘to fill: ‘cause to abound‚’ a
sense in which it is used 5, 1381.—per te: ‘through thee’; the
phrase expresses indireet agency, while ab generally implies the
