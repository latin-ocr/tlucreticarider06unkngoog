opima: the fertility of Sicily was proverbial. It was famous for both
the fineness of its stock and the variety of its fruits. By some it was
thought to be the native country of wheat3 and after the decline of
Italian farming it became one of the principal sources of the Roman
grain supply. 729. viro: Empedocles 731. carmina: all the
writings of Emped. that we know of were in verse. Fragments of
only two poems are extant, the Περὶ Φύσεως, ‘On Nature,' and the

Delphi. — quae: the antecedent is not responsa, as some make it,
but Pythia, with which dat is to be supplied. — lauro: sacred to
Apollo because of its connection with Daphne, whom the god once
loved3 as he pursued her, mother earth opened to receive the maid;

and then, to console him, produced the hay-tree. ovid, however, in .

the Metamorphoses represents Daphne as herself turned into a laurel·
tree. Those who came to the temple at Delphi as suppliants wore
wreaths of laurel. Before ascending the tripod the priestess burned

“to increase the prophetie afflatus excited by the cold air which came
out of the deep cleft.'’ ⁷4⁰- tamen Ξ repeated from 7343 ‘ Yet in
