(ii. 207). 573. corpus etc. ; ‘ for the air will be body and a living
thing if ' etc. The soul can have no feeling or sense without the
body. animans, in the broadest sense, includes both living beings and
plants3 as used by Lucr., and generally by classical writerS, it refers
only to the former, comprising both men and animals. Here it is
used indefinitely, and is hence neuter. 576-90. Transferred here
from 592-606, a change the reason for which is obvious from the
connection. 576. finis ι after intra. 579. supremo temp. ε, i.e.,
m'tae. —voltusz better spelling than vultus for the earlier authorS,
though vultus is sometimes found (cf. 3, 163), and is the form pre-
ferred by the dictionarieS. 581. an. male factum: ‘it goes ill with
the mind‚' ‘the mind is in bad way.’ 583. repraehendere z pro-
nounced as four syllables; the h is ignored and aee are blended3 cf.
n. to 152. 585. haec z fem. pl. 586. Cf. 484 et seq. 589.
aevom: masc„ as also in 2, 561, where the same phrase is found3

causat i.e., of destruction.— duobus: i.e., body and soul.

(13) On the going away of the soul the body becomes putria' ‚· the soul,
therefore, must have come forth from its inmost fastnesses. T hat this
does not escape as a whole the feeling ‘ff dying men testifies ,· hence it
must itself be torn apart and ooze away through all the openings of the
body. 595-614.

597. coorta: ‘ gathering itself up-’ Notice the *coordination of

phrase and single word in ex imo penitusque. 599-600. The lan-
guage is taken from the falling in of a building. 601. anima

emanante: Wakefield and Munro for manant animaeque ; Lach-
mann has manante anima usque. 609. supera: see n. to 1,
429. 611. quemque: distributive apposition to sensus, with
which deficere is to be supplied. Sensus alios Munro considers a
Graecism‚ like 1, 116 pecudes alias ; cf. e.g., Herod. 1, 216 θύουσί τε καὶ
ἄλλα πρόβατα ἅμα αὐτ-ῶς trans, ‘the senses as well! 614. vestem:
see n. to 386. .

(14) The fact that the mind has a particular fixed place in the organ-
ism shows that it is fitted to exist there, and nowhere else ; sor things are
not found in existence outside of their proper relations. 61 5-62 3.
