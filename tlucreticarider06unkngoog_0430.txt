368 LUCRE’rms [v. 837-

837. portenta etc.: Empedocles was the first to teach that the
earth produced all sorts of monstrosities; these perished because of
their irregularity of structure caused by the chance grouping of mem·
bers; cf. n. to 804. He, however, imagined beings of all kinds of
impossible shapeS, formed by the getting together of parts of differ-
ent animaIS, or of parts of animals and of men. But Lucr. with his
clearer conception of the unformity of nature and the reign of law
seems to have thought that the majority of living things created were
regularly formed. He has in mind here only abnormal variations
from regular' types3 cf. his reasoning 878 et seq. That such should
appear in great numbers is perfectly consistent with the rest of his

, theory. 839. interutrasque: see‘ n. to 4723 it refers, as utrum

and utrimque, to man and woman. 840.. manuum : after viduata,
a rare constr. Cf. 2, 843 secreta teporis and n. to 1, 194. For the
thought, cf. Cudworth ‘ Intellectual System‚’ ii. 595-8. 842. ad·
haesu: see n. to 3, 381. 849. debere: the verse has one syllable
too many, the only case of the kind in Lucr„ though examples are
common enough in the other poets. 853. habere etc.: (utrumque)
habere (partes) qui (=quibus)¹ etc. For qui cf. n. to 1, 168. 854.
mutent: Bernays‚ for metuent. 855. animantum: i.e., the ani·
mals of perfect organization. 857. vesci etc.: imitated by Verg-
Aen. 3, 339 vescitur aura and elsewhere. 862. aere etc.: cf. 3,
741-2. 864. levisomna: this expressive compound is found only
here. ’ 867. Memmi: see n. to 1, 26. 871. quis = quibus.
876. indupedita: see n. to 1, 82. 877. ad interitum etc.: thus
closes a spirited and remarkable statement in outline of the doctrine
known to modern scientists as “the struggle for existence '' and “ the
survival of the fittest.” Consult Darwin, ‘ Origin of Species ’ς Huxley,
‘Origin of SpecieS‚'ch. 6; Haeekel, ‘Nat. Hist. of Creation,’ ch. 73
Zeller, ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil.’ ii. 160; Lange, ‘ Hist. of Materialism,' iii. 34
et seq. 3 Elam, ‘ Winds of Doctrine‚’ p. 122 et seq.

But not even then were there Centaurs, Scyllas. and tlte like ; for such
um'ons ⁰f dissimilar natur-es could never be. Many wonderficl things the
new earth produced, but none like these. 878-924.

878. fuerunt: see n. to 1, 406. 879. bino: the singular of
bini is very rare. 880. alienigenis ε ‘heterogeneous’3 cf. 1, 865
and n. 881. potissit : for potis sit, = possit ; potisit is also found.
