probabilities it may be shown that, with the requisite number of throws
of the letters, any verse of the Iliad will be not only a possible, but
even a necessary result. For it is a possible combination, inasmuch
as it already exists3 in the shifting of letters, in infinite time, all pos-
sible combinations will appear. The universe, likewise, is a possible
combination, for it exists. Granted an infinite number of atoms
moving in infinite space through infinite time ; all possible combina-
tions‚ of which this universe is one, must result; further, in the
numberless combinatione it might be an accident of this world-com-
bination that, by a balancing of forces owing to a union of atoms
moving in different directionS, it might endure for a time; it is
known, t00, that this universe, at least the part with which we are
familiar, is undergoing gradual change,—is then in its present form
by no means permanent. But even granting to materialists that by
a chance swirl of atoms during infinite time the universe as it stands
could come into existence3 they are not a whit less dependent on a
Final Cause. Whence did the atoms get their shapeS, so that it is
possible for them to combine ? Whence did they receive the impulse
of motion, which must be postulated in order to bring about any result
whatever?—for dead matter cannot move itself. As the Stoi-c, Mani-

liuS, put it (Astron. i. 490-1) :—

quis eredat tantas operum sine numine moles
ex minimis, caecoque creatum foedere mundum?

The modern reasoner of materialistic tendencieS, however, takes
refuge in Agnosticism. Thus, Tyndall says (‘ Frag. of Sci? p. 4²1) z
“ If you ask him (the materialist) whence is this ⁸ Matter ’ of which
we have been discoursing‚ who or what divided it into moleculeS,
who or what impressed upon them this necessity of running into or-
ganic forms,—he has no answer.'’ But there must be some one to
cast the letters the requisite number of times before the verse of the
Iliad can appear3 so there must be some power to set whirling
through immensity those atoms which, in infinite time, passing into
all possible combinations‚ might have produced this one. See nn.
