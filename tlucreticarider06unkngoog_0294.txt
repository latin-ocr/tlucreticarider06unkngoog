H. 569, 11. μ on the uses of propter see n. to 65. — ferrum: the sacri-
ficial knife. 91. suo: ‘of her.’ 94. patrio: i.e. patris.—
princeps: =prima3 cf. Liv. 21, 4 Hannibal princeps m proelium
ibat, ultimus conserto proelio excedebat. Iphigenia was oldest of the
children of Agamemnon. With this line Lambinus compares Eurip.
Iph. Aul. 1222 πρώτη σ’ ἐκάλεσα πατῆσαι καὶ σὺ παῖδ’ ἐμὲ. See also
Munro’s note. 95-98. In these lines edd. notice the subtle con-
trast between the joyful wedding-scene for which the girl supposed she
had come to Aulis and the terrible reality of her⁴ doom,— a conti-ast
heightened by the studied use of terms common to both marriage and
sacrifice. 95. sublata etc-2 there is an implied reference to the
symbolic seizure of the bride from her mother in the wedding cere-
mony, and perhaps to the carrying of the bride over the threshold of
her husband. For this-and the other marriage ceremonies alluded to,
see Becker, ‘ Gallus ’ exc. 1, sc. 1 ; also Ramsay. ‘ Man. of Rom. Antiq.’
96. deducta: this word was also used of the ceremonious conduct-
ing of the bride to her new home—sacrorum: one form of the
Roman marriage was celebrated by the sacrifice of sheep (Becker,

³ ut ,ι’-ιφ. p. 158), and could not be properly concluded without the tak-

ing of auspices, 97. claro: refers to sound; ‘clear-ringing.’—
comitari ι passive. — Hymenaeo : ‘ nuptia] song.’ As the bride the
evening of the wedding day together with her husband left her father’s
house, a throng with torches chanting the marriage-song escorted them
to their new home, and sang as they entered it. Catullus (Carm. 62)
has left us a splendid specimen of the carmen nuptiale, in the form·
of a-choral chant, with youths and maidens responding alternately.
98. casta inceste: ‘sinless sinfully.’ For the paronomasia cf. 3, 1015
insegm'bus instjgm's ‚· 2, 1054 innumero numero ‚· 2, 1086. 99. mac-
tatu : found only here. 100. exitus: i e. from Aulis. —- felix
faustusque: these words were often coupled together in old formu-
las of prayer, to which the early Romans attached great signifieance,
and with which they began all transactions or work of importance. Cf.
Cic. Div. 1, 45, 102 hominum, quae vocant omina ‚· quae maiores nostri
quia valere censebant, idcirco omnibus rebus agenda} ‘ quod bonum, fa us·
tum , felix fortunatumque esset' praestabantur.

Nor let dire tales of seers affrtssght ,· these with their threatenings os
eternal woes sink lise in misery, because men know not the tmth about the
soul and the hereafler. 102-126.

102. Tutemet: i.e. Memmius, The emphatic particle met was
not attached directly to tu, but only to the already strengthened form
