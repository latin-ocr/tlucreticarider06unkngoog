or by some opaque body passing between it and the earth or bdrveen it
and the sun, or by tlte languishing of its own bmghtness. 7 51-770.

753. cur luna etc.: the commonest, and as it happens the cor-
rect view, is mentioned first. The Egyptians and the Chinese
calculated eclipses centuries before the Greeks began to speculate.
754. a terris : ‘on the side toward the earth.’ See n. to 1, 693. --- ei :
i.e., soli or lumini solis. 756. aliut: see n. to 1, 469. For the
theory cf. 717-q—facere id: see n. to 1, 667. 757-761. corre-

'expression must refer to the cone· -line shadow cast by the earth,
· through which the moon passes; menstrua agrees with the subject of

perlabi,tur referring to luna. But where does Lucr. get his cone· -like
shadow? He conceives of the earth as flat3 in this passage, then,
he must stand convicted ot a bold inconsistency, having adopted
an astronomical notion that does not harmonize with his system.
765—7. Correspond to 717-9. If this dark body comes below the
moon it shuts the moon’s light off from the earth ; if it passes above
the sun's orb, it cuts the sun's light off from the moon, making it
invisible. 768. et tamen: see n. to 1, 1050. 768-770 cor-
respond to 731 et seq. With the whole passage cf. Epicurus, Diog.

² Laert. 10, 96 ‘ Eclipses of the sun and moon may be caused by their

being extinguished, just as we see happening in regard to things on
earth, or from the interposition of other bodies, the earth or the sky
or something of the kind. Thus we must set side hyside the differ-
ent ways in which phenomena may take place, and bear in mind that
it is not impossible for several causes to concur. Now in the twelfth
book on Nature Epicurus says these things, and says further that the
sun suffers eclipse when it passes into the shadow of the moon; the
moon, when the shadow of the earth falls upon it, both sun and moon
quickly withdrawing from the shade.’ The error of Lucr. then (n. to
764) was that of his master also. From the same passage we learn
that it was shared by Diogenes the Epicurean. 770. per: with
loca.

iii. THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON THE EARTH. 771—924.

Since I have revealed the cc'zuses os all that goes on in tlte blue depths
of heaven, now I must tell qftlze new earth, what life it first brought into

being. 771-782.
