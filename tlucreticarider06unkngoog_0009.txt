PREFACE. v

F requent citations in the notes and introduction indicate
the works which the editor has found occasion to refer to in
the preparation of this book. Of the commentaries, that by
Munro has been most drawn upon. The changes in this
third edition are comparatively few, aside from the correcr

tion of some typographical errorS.
