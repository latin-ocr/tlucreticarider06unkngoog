It tls· asserted that motion can take place without void by tke displace-
ment of matter, butfalsely ,· jor without void there could be no beginning
of motion (370—383). Wrong too is the notion that when two bodies start
apart, the air between them was previously there condensed ‚· tlte air
rushes in to fill the void, but could not itself condense unless there were
void in it (384-397).

370. Illud: see n. to 8o.—vero: substantive.- 371. Aristotle
and the Stoics combated the notion that void is necessary for motion.

illum transcursus est. Sed falluntur, nam aquarum quoque similis

each proposition involves a contradiction3 aut . . . aut is used
with propositions mutually exclusive. The Epicureans admitted the
reality of motion and the existence of void ; Melissus took the other
horn of the dilemma and, denying the existence of void, sought to show
therefrom the impossibility of motion. His reasoning is interesting.
‘⁴ Every movement presupposes a void3 that which can receive
another into itself is void; that which cannot receive another is full ;
that which moves can do so only in the void. But the void would
be non-existent, and the non-existent does not exist. Consequently
there is no void, therefore no motion.’' See Zeller, ‘Prae-Socratic
Philosophy,’ i. 635. As regards the soundness of the dilemma the
’ philosophers of to-day are not much more able to pronounce with
certainty than in the time of Epicurus, for each of the ‘statements
must be treated as an induction3 and in the present limited range of
scientific knowledge, when even the atom of which men speak with
so much positiveness rests on an hypothesiS, certainty regarding them
is unattainable. 383. initum:=initium ,· so also 2, 269 initum
