302 ’ LUCRETIUS [111. 168·-

οἱ operation are ignored. The inadequate treatment of force and
motion is one of the weakest points of Lucretius’ as of all other
' ancient systems of physics. Cf. Hamilton, ‘Metaphysics‚’ p. 212.
' 168. fungi: see n. to 1, 441. 173. segnis: Munro's emend. for sua·
vis of mss.. which is meaningless in this connection. Lachmann reads
suppus. — et etc.: ‘ and on the ground the tumult of mind which
arises.' 175-6. The first statement by no means follows from the
second; because whatever the nature of the mind, so long as it remains
' in connection with the body at all, and the body is the means through
ι’ which it manifests itself, anything that affects the body must affect

, the manifestation οἱ it, whether in its nature it be affected or not.,

Τιἰε mind and soul are made up of the fines! round atoms. This is
shown by the rapidity os tlte mind ’s acuon, and by the fact tlcat aster death
no peroeplible loss os wagrlzt can be observed in tlte body. 177-2 30.

177. tibi: see n. to ι, 673.—-animus: under this term, Munro
remarks, the poet here includes anima as well, as is clear from 212
below and the rest of the paragraph. lt is the general practice of
Lucr. to keep distinct similar words when the argument requires
. it, but to use them indifferently when precision is not called for.
178. constiterit: perf. for pres. subj.‚-—a usage by no means rare.
179. persuptilem: see n. to 1, 79 opterzlur. Cf. the teaching of
Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10, 66, that the soul is composed of the
smoothest and roundest atoms etc. ς for full discussion see ref. to 140,
161. 181. hinc: refers to what follows3 hinc is more com·
monly used os what precedes. 182. videtur: passive. 183. This
line certainly implies the mind’s sels-activity,— a doctrine employed
by Plato, and after him by Cicero, to prove the immortality of the soul.
See Plat. Phaedrus 245 c; Cic. De Sen. 21, 78. 184. ergv animus se
perciet ocius quam ulla res (illorum, i.e., illarum rerum), quorum etc.
— se perciet: a kind of middle voice = passive, ‘is stirred ' ; see n.
to 1, 678. 185. ante oculos: see n. to 1, 63. 186. rutundis:
for rotundis, by assimilation. Two vowels separated by a single con·
sonant tend to become the same ; thus bene for bone, soboles for suboles.
