742-5. For Lucretius’ proof of the impossibility of motion and de-
grees of density without void, see above 329—397. 744. frugis,
‘ crops.' 745. in . . . corpus: a rare constr„ having a slightly
different meaning from in corpore. The acc. with in here carries out
the idea of ad- in the verb, that of something from without added to
the mass and mingled with it,' into it. 747. faciunt: see n. to
655. - pausam: here =finem; not found in classical Latin. —
stare: for esse. Draeger, ‘ Hist. Syntax,’ Einl. p. xiii. mentions this
use of stare by Lucr. as an archaism. For the argument cf. 528
et seq. 748. prorsum: ‘at all.’ 749. cum: concessive. For
the thought see 599 et seq. and nn. 751. conicere etc. ε ‘ infer . . .
that because the things which you do not see have a bounding point,
there is a least in them.' quod in 752 is aconjunction. 754. consti-
tuunt: has the same subj. as 743 constituunt and 740 fecere. —na-⁸
tiva: ‘ born,' ‘ having birth: not limited to living things, but used in
general ot that which has come into being, which has not existed from
infinite past time; mortali of course refers to that which is destined
to die. The two words are often used by Lucr. in the same connec-
tion, completely defining a limited as distinguished from an eternal
existence. Empedocles taught that the four elements were underived
and imperishable. 755. cum: somewhat pleonastic: see n. to
347. -— utqui: this is the reading of the MSS„ but was rejected by
editors previous to Munro for atqui, and usque (Lachmann), both of
which do violence to the thought. In utqui Munro thinks that the
qui is an affirmative particle, which has the same force as the qui in
atqui and in quippe qui in places where qui cannot be a relative, viz.
‘ Yes that,’ or the like. It is probable that, owing to a misunderstand-
ing οἱ the word, atqui and other forms stand in our texts in severa:
places where n‘tqui should be read. 758. quid ε adv. acc. of extent,
‘ how far.' — habebis: ‘ you will be able.’ 761. tempestate t see

n. to 178.

In the constant change back and forth the four primal elements cannot

be called the first-beginnings os th ings any more than things the first-begin-
