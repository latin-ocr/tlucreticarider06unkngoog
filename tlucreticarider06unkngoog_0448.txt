A Latia Grammar

265 pages. Price, 80 cents.

N this book the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre-
Ι sented within the smallest compass consistent with high
scholarly standards. It covers not only the work of the pre-
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntactical usages
found only in ante-Classical and port-classica] Latin, and by
relegating to an Appendix theoretical and historical questionS‚
it has been found possible to treat the subject with entire ade-
quacy in the compass of 250 pages exclusive of Indexes. In
the German 50110015, books of this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammar find that they are materially helped by
being relieved of the mass of useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars.

Professor Winiam A. HougIaton, Bowdoin Collega, Brunswick‚ Maine':
The Grammar proper is admirably adapted to its purpose in its clearness
of arrangement and classification‚ and in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely Just what the pupil must know, and not crowd-
ing the page with a mass of matter that too often disheartens the young
student instead of helping him. 1 trust it will come into general use, for
I think for the reasons just given, and because of its moderate compass
and attractive appearance, students are likely to get more practical gram-

matical knowledge out of it than they generally do from ‚the larger
grammars.

Professor Alfred M. Wilson, University of Nebraska, Lincoln: I have
examined it very carefully‚ and 1 can say, truly and with pleasure, that
my first impressions have become positive convictions as to the very great
value and utility of the book. 1 am daily using it with increasing delight
and satisfaction. 1t is clear, concise, and independent.

The critic, Feb. 29, 1896. The book is a marvel of condensed, yet clear
and forcible, statement. Just enough examples are given to illustrate each
principle without discouraging the pupil by their number and variety.
The ground covered in the treatment of forms and syntax is adequate

for ordinary school work and for the use of freshmen and sophomores in
college.
