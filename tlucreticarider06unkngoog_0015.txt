LUCRETIUS As A MAN, xi

poem reveals a grasp of thought, unity of plan, and power of
consecutive reasoning, such as to preclude the belief that it
was composed ‘in lucid intervals.' Still, the last books are of
unequal spirit and finish. Though abounding in magnificent
passages„ unexcelled in the first three bookS, they evince a lack
. of clearness in analysis that may be due to a waning power of
co—ordination.1 In a few places the lines seem to have been
hastily composed, and jotted down to bridge over till something
better could be written. It appears certain from the realistic‘
power of several passages that the poet was tormented by horrid
dreams and visions in sleep and· sickness ; ² these may well have
marked the incipient stages of some mental disorder. There is
no indication that Lucretius attempted any other work. Into
this one poem all the servid energy of an earnest tite was thrown.
It may be that his powerS, long wrought up to the highest ten·-
sion‚ after a few premonitions suddenly gave way3 that, plunged
into despair at the loss of mental grasp and the inability to
finish his work, following the example of one whom he looked
upon as guide and masta-,⁸ he put an end to a lise no longer
happy or usesul. PerhapS, as Sellar suggestS‚ he “may have
himself attributed what was either a disorder of his own con-
stitution, or the result of a prolonged overstrain of mind, to
the effects of some powerful drug taken in ignorance.’' The
cold satire with which he treats the passion of love may have
given rise to the tradition that his reason was wrecked by a
philter given him to stir the sluggish affections.4 In a dis-
torted way the story probably reflects some tragic fact of the
poet’s life.⁵ '
