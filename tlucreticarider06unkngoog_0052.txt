111. LUCRETIUS AS A POET.

i. LITERARY CHARAcrERISrICs OF THE DE RERUM NATURA.

Before attempting to form an estimate of Lucretius' poetic
power it is necessary to inquire, first, whether the poem stands
to-day as it was left by him3 and, secondly, whether it passed
from the author’s hands as a finished work.

It is well established that all the existing manuscripts of the
poem come from one original manuscript, known as the arche-
type. This was lost long ago. From the fact that all copies
are to be traced to one exemplar, it is obvious that wherever
that was incorrect the error has been perpetuated, and is not to
be remedied ⁴by comparison with other manuscripts. Thus it
happens that in all the texts there are certain breaks and corrupt
passageS‚ which have taxed the utmost ingenuity of commenta:
torS, without any certainty in the end of presenting what the
poet wrote. Lucretius, moreover, was one whose views the mon-

there have crept in-many interpolations and transpositions os
passages intended either to refute the argument or show the
poet’s inconsistency by quoting him against himself. These
errorS‚ as well as the unavoidable blunders that abound in
manuscriptS‚ have been mostly corrected by the able critical
scholars who have given their attention to the text, and now
“the great mass of the poem '’ is “in a sound and satisfactory
state ; '' but in some places the thought of the poet cannot be
determined.

As before remarked, there is evidence to prove that at the
poet’s death his‘ work had not yet received the finishing toucheS.
In the last three books especially there are awkward sentenceS,
ill-arranged passageS, and weak repetitions 3 occasionally whole
paragraphs are met with that ill suit the connection and are
