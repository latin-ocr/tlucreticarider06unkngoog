trary, believing that the truth about things cannot be known,
and that all the troubles of humanity come from adherence to
unfounded opinionS, endeavored to attain happiness in peace of
mind gained by withholding judgment regarding all matters, by
maintaining an absolute imperturbability. Thus the philosophy
of Epicurus, like the doctrines of the Atomists and CyrenaicS‚
from which it was so largely derived, by no means stands alone,
but forms a part os a general movement, and can be studied to
advantage only in connection with the thought and life of the
time.

Epicurus was of Athenian descent, born at Sarnos about 342
Β. c. When thirty-six years of age, it is said, he came to Athens,
and founded a school of philosophy, which met in his gai-den.
For thirty-six years he conversed and taught, gathering about

of establishing ethical principles. In this be differed from the
AtomistS, who sought knowledge of the universe for its own sake.
In accordance with the division of philosophy current in his
time, he divided his system into ethics‚ physiCS,-and dialectiC, ’

'considering the two latter as entirely ancillary to the first. Dia-

from the Cyrenaics. For a few distinctions he was i'ndebted to
Aristotle.1 Sense-pe-r—ception in his system belonged under the

on the senses by means of the air, strike upon them directly,

and even penetrate to the mind. The old physics and ethics in
