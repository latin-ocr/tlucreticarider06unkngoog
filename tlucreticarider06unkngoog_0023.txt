LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xix

strate was water; AnaximeneS‚ air3 Anaximander, an infinite,
indefinite substance. The Pythagoreans grasped at the idea of
the essential differenee between spirit and matter, but yet were
not able in their thinking to purge matter of psychical qualities;
hence their doctrine of the world-soul. The Eleatics recognized
more clearly than they the antagonism between matter and
spirit, but relegated the former to the domain of pure phenom·
ena, denying the reality of change and making being and
thought identica13 to them the universe was one vast, change-
less thought. Heraclitus1 assumed fire as the fundamental
matter, and attributed to it psychical properties, taking it as both
cause and symbol of change, the reality of which he maintained
in opposition to the Eleatic doctrine. The Atomists rank with
Empedocles² and Anaxagoras⁸ as the first who made complete
severance of the physical and the psychical, - matter and mov-
ing cause ; and wh0‚ in order to explain changes and the on—going
of the universe, assumed the operation of some principle entirely
outside of matter and above it. Empedocles taught that there
are four ultimate forms of matter, or elements3 and two influ-
enceS, or directing forces‚⁴ acting upon them. Anaxagoras as-
sumed an indefinite number of primitive substanceS‚ infinitely
divisible‚ and a rational force as final cause. Midway between
the two came the Atomists, who made an advance upon Empe-
docles in positing a single ultimate matter, made up of indivisible
particleS, the different shapes of which explained the possibility
of all combinations; but they adopted a less philosophie con·
ception of moving cause than AnaxagoraS, appealing to the
inadequate law of necessity.

The Atomists were tWO‚ Leucippus and Democritus. of the
former little is known save that be furnished the basis of the
theory of the latter. Democritus⁵ was born about 460 Β. c. Ac·
cording to him there is matter, or the “full;'’ and there is
“void,” or space devoid of matter. The latter must be consid·
