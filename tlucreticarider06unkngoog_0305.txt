(6) The spontaneous products of the earth would far surpass those
chertlrlzed by human toil. 208—2r4.

208. postremo: notice with what skill the poet varies the words
introducing the various points, so that a formal enumeration is pre-
served without marring the poetic effect ; 174 praeterea, 184 nec porro,
192 huc. 199 denique, 208 postremo. 209. manibus: not dat.‚ but
abl. of means or instrument. 210. esse etc. τ supply fiztena’um est.
213. quaeque: see n. to 129.

2. To nothing nought returns. 215-264.

215. corpora: for corpora primm—dissoluat: generally after q,
g, s, l, and r the semi-vowel v has the force of a consonant. But in
soluere and compounds, and a few other words, it is often treated by
the poets as a vowel. Thus here disso‘lae‘c‘at. For other exceptions
cf. nn. to 560 relicu‘o ; 5, 679 conseqiie. Suemus (1, 603 1, 301 and often)
is sometimes pronounced as a dissyllable, sometimes as a trisyl-
lable. See Roby‚ 94, 2. 216. interemat ε this spelling, for the
Classical period, rests on better MSS. authority than interimat, though
Brambach (‘ Latin Orthography’ Trans„ p. 97) and the Latin diction-
aries prefer the latter. So we should write neglego, intellego, peremo.
See Munr0, ‘Lucr.,' p. 33. Cf. FestuS, p. 217, Mull. With the
thought cf. the teaching of Democritus given in Diog. Laert.‚ 9, 44,
⁶ and not anything is destroyed into the non-existent.’ For the modern
view of the indestructibility of matter see nn. to 150, 483.

(1) If things could he resolved into nothing, they maght without 'force
suddenly disappear from stglzt and perish utterly. 217-224.

217-8. Cf. the argument of Epicurus: ‘And if that which disap-
pears were destroyed into the non-existent, all things would perish
utterly, since there would not be things into which they could be
resolved ' (Diog. Laert.‚ ιο. 24, 39 καὶ εἷ ἐφθείρετο δὲ τὸ ἀφανιζόμενον
εἷς τὸ μὴ ὅν, πάντα ἃν ἀπολώλει τὰ πράγματα, οὐκ ὄντων τῶν εἷς ἃ
διελύετο). Cf. also Cudworth, ‘Intellectual System,’ ch. 1, ἓ 28.
221. quod nunc ‘whereas in truth,' forms a transition from the
false to the true view, like 169 at nunc. See n. on 82 quod contra.
222. donec: with the indic„ as generally in Lucr.—ictu: see n. on
