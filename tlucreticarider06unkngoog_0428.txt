by the Pythagoream, Stoics, and many otherS‚ that the life of animals
ι is a part os the great universal life‚—a fragment, as it were, of the
world-soul. The Epicureans were especially hostile to the belief that
man has any spark of th· divine in him, —

sive hunc' divino semine fecit
ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo,
sive recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto ,
aethere, cognati retinebat semina caeli. (Ov- Μοι- 1, 78-81.)

cf. 2, 1154-5. 794. nec ter. etc.: in opposition to the view of
Anaximander, that the first life was generated by the heat of the sun
in the primal slime as the earth was becoming dry; and that “the
land animals, including man, had at first been fishes, and afterwards,
when they were able to develop themselves under their new shape,
they had come on shore and thrown off their scales.” See Zeller,
‘ Prae-Soc. Phil! i. 255-6. The fanciful theory of the idealist, Oken,
is strikingly similar; see his ‘Physio-Philosophy,’ trans. by Tulk,
§900 etseq. .· “Every organic has issued out of mucus; the primary
mucus, out of which every organic has been created, is the sea·
mucus. The sea-mucus was originally generated through the influ-

Light shines upon the salted sea and it liveS.” Diod. Sic. (3, 2)
says that the first men formed were the Ethiopians, because as the
moist earth dried off ‘it was natural that the spot nearest the sun
should be the first to produce animate natures’ (φύσεις ἐμψύχους).
795. maternum nomen: see nn. to 1, 250—1. Into the popular no·
tion the poet projects a deep philosophie significance. 797- 8.
Cf. 2, 871—3 and n. to 3, 713. 801. alituum ε = alitum ; length-
ened to suit the dactylic measure; so 1039, 1078; 2, 928³ 6, 1216.
802. ova : how the eggs were produced the poet does not explain.
804. lincunt: see n. to 3, 553.—sponte sua etc.: throughout-the
passage the implication is that the living things spontaneously pro-
duced by the earth came forth fully formed and adapted to the condi·
tions of existence. This is in opposition to the teaching of EmpedocleS,
that the different parts of animals and men grew up separately out of
the earth. being at length united into beings through Love. Cf. n.
to 1, 716. Lucr. agrees with Empedocles, however, in supposing that
plants came into existence before animals. Diogenes of Apollonia,
Parmenides and Democritus believed that animal life was first pro-
