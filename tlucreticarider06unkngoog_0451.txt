Livy, Books J., XXI„ and XXII.

With Introduction and Notes by Professor JoRN H. VVESTCOTT, Col-
lege of New Jersey‚ Princeton. 12mo, cloth, 426 pageS. Price, 3125.

N attempt has been made in this volume to present in sim-
ple and convenient form the assistance needed by young
students making their first acquaintance with Livy.

The editor's experience in the class-room has led him to
annotate the text copiously. On the other hand. that fulness of
illustration which apparently aims to Supersede the function
of th'e teacher has been carefully avoided.

Dr. Cecil F. P. Bancroft, Principal of Phillips Academy, A ndo-ver, Mass. .·
1 have been using Westcott's Livy this term and last, and it seems to me
an excellent book.

¹ Professor charles Ε. Bennett, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y..· 1t seems
to me an excellent book. 1 examined part of the notes, and found them
exceedingly fresh and scholarly. They call attention to the right things,
and in the right way. This edition is superior to any similar edition with
which 1 am acquainted.

Professor Samuel Han, T rinity Collega, Harfford, Conn..· 1 am greatly
pleased with Professor Westcott’s Livy. It is admirably annotated, and
cannot but be of great and real service.

Professor James Η. ninam, T ulane University‚ New Orleans, La. .· 1
should like to say that Westcott's Livy is the most satisfactory text-book
that 1 know of. Other works may put on a greater show of learning; but
when one comes to every-day class-roem use, the editing of this text is
found to be exceptionally satisfactory.

Professor W. B. Owen, Lafayette College, Easton, Pa. .· 1 take great pleas-
ure in expressing my gratification. The text is a delig'nt to the eye, and
the notes are clear and judicious‚ well suited to the wants of students at
the stage when Livy ιε usually read.

Professor Edgar J. Shumway, Ncw Brunswick, N. J.: The clear yet con-
eise introduction‚ and full, clearly expressed noteS, together with typo-
graphic excellence of the book, render the edition one of great value-
