rest of the universe built around it; and insisted on the unity and
perfection of the universe, emphasizing in everything the adaptation

of means to end. —quodffi supply id. 1054. mun. nat. =
mundum. See n. to 73. 1055. ‘and the uppermost and lowest
parts cannot part asunder in any direction.' 1058. The constr.

after credere, interrupted by 1057, which is parenthetical, is here re-
sumed.—- sursum: i.e., from the lower side up toward the common
centre. The Epicureans did not realize that in space there can be no
up and down. But this error was not by any means universal in anti—
quity, as is sometimes supposed. Cf. Plato, ‘ Timaeus ' 62, c.: ‘ It is
quite erroneous to suppose that there are two opposite regions in the
universe, one above and the other below, and that heavy things natu-
rally tend to the latter place. The heavens are spherical, and every-
thing tends to the centre; and thus above and below have 110
real meaning. If there be a solid globe in the middle, and if a per-
son walk around it, he will become the antipodes to himself, and
the direction which is up at one time will 110 down at another.'
See Whewell, ‘Hist. of the Inductive Sciences,' 3 ed. additions to
ch. 33 cf. 996-1001 and n. 1059. ‘are at rest on the earth

1061-7. Cf. Cic. Acad. 2, 39, 123 vos etiam dicias csse e regy‘one nobis,
e contraria parte terrae, qui adverszlr vestigiis· stent contra nostra vestzgnkz, ῃ
quos ἀντίποδας vocatis ; also Id. Tusc. Dis. 1, 28, 68. The doctrine of
antipodes is assigned by Diog. Laert. (8, 26) to Pythagoras; but the
same writer elsewhere says (3, 24) that Plato was the first to use the
word. Cf. Verg. Georg. 1, 247 et seq. ,· Plin. N. H. 2, 653 Strab0, 15.
“ The existence of antipodes was, of course, bound up with the doc-
trine that the universe or the world is a globe (held by Plato and the
Stoics) ; hence the early Christian writers attack the two ideas
together as unscriptural.'' Lactantius, Inst. 3, 23 Quid illi, qui esse con-
trarios vestzgriis nostris antipodes putant ? num aliquid loquuntur ? aut
est quisquam tam ineptus, qui credat esse homines, quorum vestzgia sint
superiora quam capita? etc. St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei 16, 9) is
equally severe. As late as 1616, in the pontificate of Paul V.‚ a de-
cree of the Catholic Church ordered that all books teaching the mo-
bility of‘the earth and the immobility of the sun (a doctrine essentially

connected with the preceding) should be ‘suspended, forbidden, and ,
condemned.’ Consult Whewell, ref. in 11. 10 1058; Reid's n. to Aoed. ἑ
