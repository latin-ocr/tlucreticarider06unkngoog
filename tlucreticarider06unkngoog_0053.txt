clearly out of place, probably inserted by the poet as a make-
shift till some better setting could be found for them. The
allusion to Cicero’s editorship in the passage from·Jerome
quoted above has given rise to much discussion ; some, as Lach-
mann, think that Quintus Cicero is referred to, while Munro
and others suppose that the orator is meant. Of course Jerome
had the orator in mind, for in his day as now, when Cicero
was spoken of, men thought of the great Cicero. Although
there is some reason for supposing that Quintus acted as editor
of the poem, it is far more likely that the task fell upon Marem,
who “may have spent only a few hours in looking over it or
hearing it read to him3 his name rather than his time was prob-
ably wanted by the friends of Lucretius.” At any rate the
poem seems to have been “given to the world exactly as it was
left by the author, with nothing added or taken from it to all
appearance.'’ Thus says the highest critical authority upon the
text, and his statement may be sustained by many evidences
which it is not necessary to present. Suffice it to say that not-
withstanding the uncompleted state of the poem, and the hope-
less corruptions and lacunae, there is manifest a literary ability
‘unexeelled by that of any Latin writer. In the unfolding and
treatment of the organic idea, as well as in the manner of ex·
pression and the music of the verse, poetic genius of a high
order is revealed.

The De Rerum Natura is a didactic poem with an ethical
purpose. The organic idea iS,—without the activity or inter-
vention of any divine power the proeesses of nature and of life
ever go on. The purpose iS,—to free men from the ills of
superstition. Herein is sounded the key-note of the whole.
The aim and the organic idea are never lost sight of. Hence
the poem possesses unity3 the parts all fit into a general plan.
There is something like an epic movement, which does not
come from the verse alone, but from the onward sweep of
thought. Especially in certain passages about life and death
and the actions of men, and in some descriptions of changeS,
the true epic spirit is felt. '
