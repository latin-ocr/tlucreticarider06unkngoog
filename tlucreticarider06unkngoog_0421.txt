621. vel: intensive. 622. Cf. 3, 371 and n. 624. caeli tur·
bine : assumed in the first explanation of the movements of the stam,
510 above. 625. evanescere: dicdDemocritus. Cf. 535.—inius:
caeli turbinis. 628. fervida signa: wrongly explained by Zel-
ler‚ ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil! ii. 250, n. 3 as “ the signs of the Zodiac in which
the sun is in summer.'' They are rather, as Munro observeS, those
signs of the Zodiac which are higher‚ and hence are carried on in
more rapid revolution. 629-31. The nearer the moon's course is
to the earth the less able it is to keep up with the swifter-moving
signs above it. 635-6. The signs in their swifter revolution come up
to the moon and pass by it (praeterque feruntur). Now they com-
plete their circuit and overtake it again, and so on; the moon in
consequence appears to be travelling faster than they in an oppo-
site direction; it seems to be hastening to meet the signs, when in
reality they are going much §aster in the same direction, and continu·
ally overtaking it. 637. aer: the poet has in mind two air·
currents, as indicated by alter in 638 : the one blows the sun from the

signs to those of summer. Cf. 11. to 511 ae‘ra. 638. alternis:

lar revolutions; see 11. to 1, 1029. But cf. Diod. Sic. 2, 46 λέγεται

ὀνομάζεσθαι. The line is imitated from Cicero's Aratea3 see 11. to 1,
162. In his n. to 619 annua Munro gives a number of passages that
show the influence of the Aratea. 646. diversis etc.: ‘with
winds blowing from opposite quarters the clouds go in opposite di-

rectionS‚ the lower in a way contrary to the upper.' 648. qui: ’

see 11. to 1, 168. Epicurus assigns four possible causes for the mo-
tions of the sun and moon, Diog. Laert. 10, 93 ‘The movements of
the sun and moon between the tropics may be due either to the ob-
