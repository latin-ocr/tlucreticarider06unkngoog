existence3 see n. to 1, 113. 671. insinuatur: see n. to 1, 113.
672. super: = insuper, praeterea. See Holtze, ‘ Syn. Lucr. Linea·
menta,’ p. 101. ⁶75· retinentia: rare, perhaps found only here
and 851 below. For the thought compare Wordsworth‚ ‘ Ode 'on the
Intimations of Immortality from the Recollections of Childhood:
678. interiisse: supply animam.

The two following arguments are closely related,
and also assume the doctrine of pre-existence:—

(18) [f the soul were introduced into man at birth, it would not per·
vade the ‘entire body, but be gathered together in one particular spot, as in a
hole by itself5 whereas on the contrary the whole body, even to the teeth
and bones, is sensitive. 679-697.

(19) Again, on the same supposition, in being thus dgffused through the
body, the soul must peris-h ,· just as food &reading throughout the frame
peri-thes, and goes to form a new nature. 698-7 12.

. 679. perf. corp. : i.e., when the body is fully formed, and ready to
be born. 680. an. viv. potes: see n. to 1, 72. 682. con-
veniebat, etc. :“ conv. vivere ita ut videatur cresse (== crevisse) etc.
685. “Clearly a sarcastic gloss ; ’' rejected by Lambinus etc., but re-
tained by Lachmann, who instead of affluat reads arceat. · 689. mor-
bus: i.e., dolor dentium. 690. oppressus: i.e., dentibus ‚-
‘ crunched.’-· frugibus: by metonymy for pane. 691-2. That is,
souls had a beginning, and must have an end, of life. 700. qui·
que: old abl„ found only here and in the same phrase 5, 3433
strengthens magis. The qui is probably the same as in utqui. See
Munro's n. to 1, 755. 701. The argument of the iine is a good
iliustration of the non sequitur. 705. quamvis: with indic.; see
n. to 403. —recens : belongs with corpus. 710. illa: i.e., anima.

(20) Are particles of the soul left behind in the dead body or not?
[f so, the soul cannot be immortal‚ since it has been diveded ; if not,
whence come the souls of the living things that appear in carcasses ,θ’
These cannot comefrom without ; for, do we suppose ⁸ that while bodiless
they hunted around and got bodies ἓ Α disembodied soul would have no
motivefor taking upon itself the ills and pains of existence in a body, and
could not make for itself a body, even if it should so desire. Or do we
imagine that they entered bodies fully formed Ρ In that case, they
would not be so closely connected with these as to have common feeling.
