270 LUCRETIUS [1. 692-

2, 236. The original quantity of the e was doubtless long: but in the
later poets it is generally short Cf. n. on 3, 918 νὲΞ.

T hat all things are of fire cambati* the evidence of tlte senses, which is
to be accepted as final. 690-704.

692. hic idem: i.e., Heraclitus, —perdelirurn. The Stoics and
the EpicureanS, but particularly the latter, were famous for abuse of
opponents and their views: see Cic. N. D. 1, ἓξ 93-4. In this respect
Lucr. stands in marked contrast to most of his school, for he gen·
erally speaks of those whom he is refuting with moderatiori and
courtesy. Philosophers ot to-day, however, should not be hasty in
criticising the narrow spirit of ancient thinkers. Biichner (preface
to ‘Kraft und Stoff‘) alludes to his opponents as ‘yelping curs,’
‘mental slave5,’ ‘a howling pack '; and even Tyndall, generally so
fairminded, speaks of ‘brawler' and ‘clown.’ Cf. Wainwright ‘ Sci-
entific Sophisms,' ch. 1 ; Elam, ‘ Winds of Doctrine‚’ p. 132. 693.
ab: ‘from the side of,’ i.e., ‘ on the side of ’ς see Roby, 1813. To be
consistent with his doctrine of perpetual change, Heraclitus had to
discredit the evidence of the senses, which show us many things
apparently firm and changeless. See Zeller, ‘ Prae-Soc. Phil! ii. 88.
695. ignem: attracted to the ace. from its proper constr. as nom. to
cogn. est.—ipsi: Heraclilo. 696-7. Fire he thought to be “the
only sensible phenomenon in which the substance of things displays
itself‚ according to its true nature.'' 699-700. That the senses
never deceive was a cardinal tenet of the Epicurean theory of knowl-
edge; see 4, 378-52'1 and Introd. Thorough-going materialists in all
ages, while boasting of the certainty of their systems as founded upon
the evidence of the senses, have been prone to forget that the atom,
which lies at the foundation, is entirely beyond the ken of sense3 and

· thus the whole superstructure of asserted trnth remains bnt a hypoth-

esis incapable of verification. They should be last, therefore, to criti-
cise those who build on something independent of the senses or even

opposed to them. Cf. 483-502 ; 599 et seq. 700. qui ε indecl. abl. ,

here =qu0‚ having as antecedent quid. This form is found also in
quicum, and may be used of either number ancl all three genders.
From it carne qui-n, qui-pe (qutjzfipe) and the like. „ 703. ne'get:
subj. of result3 with quam the ut is often omitted. A. 332, b. ,· H.
502, 2. Ample illustration of the usage is given by Draeger, ‘Hist
Syntax der Lat. Sprache,' ii. ,ξ 520, 2.
