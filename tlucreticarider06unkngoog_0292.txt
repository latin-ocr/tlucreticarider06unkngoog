and Roman beliefS. Not unlike the sentiment of the text is that of

the Italian Pomponatius (died 1525), who declared “philosophers
alone to be gods of the earth, and as far removed from all other

men, of whatever condition, as real men are from painted men.'' See
Lange, ‘ Hist. of Materialism‚’ Am. edit. 1, 22 5.

Fear not impiety in thus casting away religion ‚· relig-lon herself llas
caused the foulest crimes. W itness Iphigenia, slain by lter sire to appease
Diana's wratlz. 80-101.

80. Illud: refers to something following, — a common use in both
prose and verse. A. 102, b ,· G. 292, Rem. 13 H. 450, 3. Illud in his
rebus is a favorite phrase of our poet in introducing a new point. Cf.
1, 3703 1, 10523 3, 370 etc. 81. inpia: less common than the as·
similated form impia. The early Romans met with stern disfavor any-
thing that tended to weaken the hold of the old religion upon the
people. Cato the Censor viewed with alarm the stay of Carneades and

¹ his fellow-philosophers at Rome, though they were on public business.

In the poet's day, however, the edu cated classes no longer accepted lit-
erally the myths of the old saith, and the public religious rites became
merely an instrument in the hands of designing politicians for control·
ling the credulous masses. It is not likely that Memmius and his friends
would have been greatly shockedbby any doctrine the poet might pro-

pound3 but this passage shows wonderful skill in meeting possible ’

prejudiceS, and arousing the feelings to a favorable reception of what-
ever might follow. 82. indugredi: '= ingredi. Indu and endu are
old forms for in. The Twelve Tables have endo with both acc. and abl.
Ennius uses endo with the acc., indo with the abl. Plautus has indu
· only in the verb indaudire. Lucr. has indu manu (2, 1096), endo npari
(6, 890) and indu manus (5, 102), besides indu in several compounds.
The old form survived to the Classical period in such words as indi-
geo, indegena, industria. —- quod contra: = ὃ τούναντίον ‘ whereas on
the contrary.’ Contra is here an adv., as generally in ante-classica]
writers; quod is merely a connecting link between the clauseS, as in quoa
si at the beginning of sentences and clauses and the like ; it was origi-
nally an adv. acc., or perhaps, as some maintain, an abl. in the sense
of qua re, quam ob rem. Cf. Cic. De Sen. 23, 843 De Am. 24, 90 and
Reid's n. Cf. also use of b in Thuc. 2, 40 b τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀμαθία μὲν
θράσος κτλ, and the ⁸ which ' often in vulgar English. See Roby 1897
and foot·n. for the common view that quod is governed here by contra out
