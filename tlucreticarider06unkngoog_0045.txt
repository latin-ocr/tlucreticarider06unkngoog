2. Atomism, Ancient and Modern.

The Atomic theory of the constitution of matter has a history
full os interest and importance. ·1t formed the groundwork of
a Hindu system of philosophy. Introduced into Greek thought
by Leucippus and developed by DemocrituS, it was made by the
Epicureans the physical basis of an ethics of pleasure. Bacon
brought it into modern science‚ and Boyle applied it to Chem-
istry 3 2 while Gassendi attracted attention to its relation to the
problem os the universe. To-day the atomic theory of matter
is the dominant one among both scientific investigators and
philosophers, accepted often as unquestionable truth alike by
chemists and physicistS, atheists and divines. It still remains,
as in the time of DemocrituS, an unverified hypothesis. But
while it is no longer wedded to any one theory of the universe,
it is often without good reason distinctively associated with the
doctrines of materialistic evolution. In tracing the history of
atomism‚ the two most important things to be considered are,
the nature of the atom, and the means by which the relations
of atoms with one another are thought to be adjusted.

The early Greek atomists conceived of the atoms as perfectly
hard and eternally existent, with a tendency to move downward
because of inherent weight‚ the heavier going {aster than the
lighter. For a causal principle they adopted the law of neces·
sity (doubtless taken from the old religion) ; and for a principle
