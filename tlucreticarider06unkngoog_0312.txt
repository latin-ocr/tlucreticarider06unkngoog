2 50 LUCRE‘rms [1. 340-

stand in its regular place as first word of the clause. In prose, how-
ever, it often yields its position to an emphatic word. Cf. 345; 4,
933. 340. sublima: sublimus was a rare collateral form of sublimis.
Lucr. does not use the latter. On the other hand, sublime is the
common form of the adv„ and sublimiter is rare. With the threefold
division of the world cf. 278. 341. multa modis multis = Lucr. is
fond of this expression, the alliteration and paronomasia of which
seem to have struck his fancy. The Latins in general showed a fond-
ness for placing near together words that sounded alike. Cf. A. 344, g,-
G. 6833 H. 563. 343. non . . . priv. caret. etc.: i.e. on the
principle that a thing cannot be said to be deprived of that which it
never possessed—sollicito: with the derivational meaning (sollus,
cognate with ὅλος, w h ol e, and citus part. of ciere) ‘ wholly in motion‚’
‘restlessss So 3, 732; 6, 1038 and 1185. 346. solidae: solidus,
Munro observes, is the technical term of our poet for what is ‘⁴ per·
fectly solid and impenetrable, that is, his first-beginnings; in this sense
no res can be solida.” See n. to 223. 347. cum: hardly necessary
here, as the simple abl. of characteristic would have fully expressed
the meaning. Trans. ‘endowed with: ‘ having.' This pleonastic use
of cum is not uncommon. See Roby‚ 1881; Madvig, 258. 350.
omne: not ‘every’ nor ‘whole,' but ‘throughout,' ‘every part 'oh'

351. Observe the chiasmus; see n. to 22-23.—-fundunt: Lucr. is ⁴

fond of this word. Cf. 17 53 Cic. De Sen. 14, 5¹ fhnditfrugem spici
ordine structam. 352. totas: supply arbores from arbusta above.
In 253 the use of drbo'ris is avoided by supplying ipsae from preceding
arboribus. See n. to 187. 356. inania: see n. to 223. — pose-inu
Munro’s reading for possent ; a judicious change. So below 593, 597,
645. 358 et seq. For this and other Epicurean arguments re·
garding the void see Zeller ‘ Prae-SocsPhil„ ii„ 2183 ‘ StoicS, Epicu-
reans and Sceptics ’ ch. 17. 360. glomere ε the o, short by nature,
is here made long. 361. par est: ‘it is natural! 362. deorsum:
scanned cle-orsum. The Epicurean view that matter tends downward
by its own weight is explained 2, 184-215. 363. inanis ε substan-
tive, dep. on natura ,⁰ natura inanis, like natura aquai, mellis, animi.
etc.‚ is somewhat pleonastic. 364. que: ‘ and yet,’ mildly adversa-
tive3 a use sometimes found in both prose ancl verse, more frequently
after a negative. 365. nimirum = ‘ beyond doubt‚’ emphatic.
This is a favorite word of Lucr. in introducing a strong assertion.
368. est = existit ; emphatic by position.
