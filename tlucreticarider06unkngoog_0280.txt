218 LUCRETIUS [Ι. 1-

in the gen. pl. of the second decl. is not a contracted form, but the
original Italian ending, which in Latin became -0m after v. It was
later in Latin superseded by vrum. See Roby, ‘Latin Grammar,’
ᾗ 365. Lucr. has deorum but once (6, 54), though divom and deum are
found many times without difference of meaning. The poet’s choice
between the different forms was perhaps governed by the mette.—
voluptas: Venus as goddess of love could with propriety be called
hominum divomque voluptas ,· for the ancient mythology pictured the
gods with the same joys ‘and passions as men. See the striking pas·
sage in Cic. N. D. 1, 16, 42. Cf. 6, 94 requies hominum dt'vomque
voluptas, where Calliope is invoked. 2. alma: ‘increase-giving.’
The gliding movement of the verse well suits the sense.

Venus t the Epicureans believed not at all in the influence of the
Divine over the affairs of men. Why, then, does Lucretius begin his
poem with an invocation to Venus? The question is not an easy one
to answer. It was the custom of the poets to preface any important
work with an address to the gods or some particular divinity for
inspiration. Prose writerS, τοο, sometimes followed their example.
Varro opens the ‘De Re Rustica ’ with a labored prayer to the gods
of the farmer. Whatever may have been the motive of such invo-
cations at first, after the decline of the old religion in Greece and
Rome to educated readers and hearers they no longer suggested
any thought of the real presence of the Divine; they fumished merely
an occasion for the dignified display of a bit of literary finery. Hence
the spiritless invocation of Ovid at the beginning of the Metamor-
phoses3 instances of the like, with many others, some graceful and
some dull, may be found in the writings of his¹ contemporaries and
the poets of the decline. Of similar character is Lucretius’ address
to Calliope, quoted above. But while Lucretius in thus opening his
poem was conforming to the example of the poets from Homer to
Ennius», with him it was not a matter of display or trifling. These
lines breathe an intense earnestness. Filled with bright images, they
hurry the thought along with resistless force. What, then, the secret
of their power ?

Lucretius conceived of the world as under the reign of law (see
n. to 1, 586). Not chance, but fixed order,—inconsistent as this
may appear by the side of his doctrine of the atom, — seemed to him
the key to the mysteries of the operations of nature. To him, as
to thinking men of all ages, the strangest thing in all the mecha·
