LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xlvii

like his, is largely ethical.¹ Their psychology agrees with his, at
least negatively, in denying the intuitions. Their theory of the
supreme good is at bottom the same, though arrived at in a
somewbat different way. The view of man’s development in
civilization and the origin of institutions set forth by Lucretius
anticipated important modern theorieS, which are by no means
confined to the doctrines of materialists, but which, in part
at least, have been confirmed by the late investigations of
archaeologistS‚ and are generally accepted.²

All that is most valuable and suggestive in Lucretius’ doctrine
of the atom has its counterpart in modern science3 and the
atomic Materialism of the day, stripped of what belongs not
alone to it but to science in general, to theistic as well as to
atheistic and agnostic theories of the universe, is precisely
Lucretius' doctrine of the nature of thingS, less the blunders in
fact and method unavoidable in the state of knowledge of his
time. Great as is the scientific value of the doctrine of evolu-
tion as a working hypothesis in investigation, as a convenient
system of classification for related facts of the organic world,
when applied to the explanation of the universe with no God
it breaks down utterly. The materialistic evolution of our time,
then, is simply the Materialism of Lucretius. wrought over in
accordance with the scientific methods and adapted to the scien—
tific knowledge of our day. Subjected to the scrutiny of careful
criticism‚ it is found to be not a whit nearer to a settlernent of
the fundamental questions of existence than the system of the

Roman poet.
