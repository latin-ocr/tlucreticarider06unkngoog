earth as the parents of all; when now the old religions became a thing
of the past,¹abandoned as superstitious by the higher classes of soci-
ety to the ignorant and credulous, the forms of worship were still
: kept up. Many, indeed, particularly the Stoics, tried by rationalistic
explanations to adapt the old myths about gods and heroes to their
philosophie views. Cf. eg. 2, 652-660. But they were inwrought into
the folk-life of both Greece and Rome. Attempts to explain them to
accord with natural law vvere never popular. Finally, discarded as
beliefs they remained as poetry. To Ennius, LucretiuS, to Catullus,
α Vergil and Horace, gods ancl goddesses were but stuff for poeti-y,—
conceptions about which were gathered associations bright and beauti-
ful, or sad and stern, traditions of power and passion that gave scope
for all sorts of poetic license. But in this and like passages the per-
sonification of sky and earth doubtless meant far more to Lucr. than
to most of his contemporaries, on account of its philosophical signifi·
cance. Under the beauty of description lies a deep and wide-reaching
truth. Cf. n. on 2 Venus. 251. matris terrai. Cf. 2, 589-660;
5, 821 ; Vergil has imitated this passage, Georg. 2, 325-7:
Tum pater omnipotens fecundis imbribus aether

Coniugis in gremium laetae descendit, et omnis
Magnus alit, magno commixtus corpore, fetus.

253. ipsae: supply arbores. Cf. 3 52 totas and n. 255. pueris:
‘children’ Florere, meaning ‘to abound with,’ is followed by the
ordinary constr. with verbs of plenty. Cf. 5, 1442.- 257. pingui:
substantive in the abl„ limiting fessae. 26ο. artubus ε Lucr. has
artibus but once, 5, 1077. 261. mentes: for corda or pectora.
Cf. 1, 13. 262. penitus: see n. to 145. videntur: supply
perire. 263. alid ε a collateral form of aliud, like alis for alius, ali
for alii. See Roby, 3733 Neue, ‘ F ormenlehre,’ ii. 214. In the time

, of Lucr. these forms were already archaic. See Draeger, ‘ Hist. Syn-

tax d. Lat. Sprache,’ Einl. p. xii. 264. morte. . . aliena: i.e.
alterius rei interitu, as Lambinus explains. That the death of one
thing is the birth of another was a maxim of the ancient physicists.
Munro quotes one form of it in Greek from Arist. Met., 2, 2, p. 994,
b, 5 ἦ θατέρου φθορὰ θατέρου ἐστὶ γένεσις. Of the doctrine itself he
well remarks that “ as here applied to this world of ours, it is perhaps
, hardly consistent with what is said below 556, that the process of
destruction is much quicker than that of construction. Elsewhere
Lucr. argues at great length and with much earnestness that this
