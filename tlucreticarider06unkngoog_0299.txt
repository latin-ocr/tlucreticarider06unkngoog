ap. Cic. Fam. 8, 5 ego quidem vehementer anim ipendeo. It seems
to be a survival from the locative case, like belli, domi. See Roby‚.
1168, 1321. Once at least, however, fallere appears to be accompa-
uied by a gen. of separation after the Greek constr„ Plaut. Ep. 2, 2, 57
nec sat exaudibam, nec sermonis fallebar tamen. See Kiihner,

137-9. The difficulties Lucr. had to contend with were doubtless
great. His predecessors in philosophy had written in a barbarous style
(Cic. Acad. 1, 2, 5; Fin. 3, 12, 403 Tusc. Disp. 2, 3, 7; 3, 15, 333 4, 3,
6-7), and the Latin in his time had properly speaking no philosophical
vocabulary. To the fact that he had to coin or use in new sense many
terms was added the difficulty of expressing philosophie thoughts in
verse. His skill in surmounting both obstacles is attested by every
page of the poem. Cicero also complains of the poverty of the Latin'
tongue; see N. D. 1, 4, 8 complures enim Graecis institutionibus eruditi
ea, quae didicerant, cum civibus suis communicare non poterant, quod
illa, quae a Graecis accepissent, Latine dici posse dffderent; also Tusc.
Disp. 2, 15, 35. But when his patriotism gets the better of him he does
not hesitate to affirm the contrary3 see De Fin. 1, 3, 10 Latinam linguam
non modo non inopem, ut vulgo putarent, sed locupletiorem etiam esse quam
Graecam ; cf. also id. 3, 2, 5. Cf. p. 1. 138. multa: see n. on 111
poenas. 141. amicitiae: the use of this and similar expressions
regarding the relation between Lucr. and Memmius is thought to give
a clue to the poet's social position. See p. x. 143. demum:
with possim. 145. penitus: with convisere, not occultas ; trans
‘entirely,’ ‘thoroughly,' as generally in Lucr.

1. From nothing nothing is produced. 146-214.

This dread and darkness ‘.'f the mind must be dispelled by knowledge
of nature and her laws ,· of which the first principle is, that nougkt from
nothing ever comes by divine power. 146-1 58.

146—8. These lines several times occur, keeping always prominent
the thought that physical knowledge has no end in itself, but is simply
