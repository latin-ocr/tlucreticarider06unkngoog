501. aerias auras: see n. to 1, 771. 503. haee ε i.e., below.
505. impete .· for impetu ,· so several times in Lucr. With our poet's
description of the aether cf. that of the Stoic in Cic. N. D. 2, 40, 101 ulti·
m us et a domictlzis nostris altissimis omnia cingens et coe‘rcens caeli com-
plexus, qui idem aether vocatur, extrema ora et determinatio mundi, in
quo cum admirabilitate maxima igneae formae cursus ordinatos definiunt.

¹ The Stoics believed that the heavenly bodies are in the aether, the

Epicureans that they are mostly between the aether and the earth,
in the air. 507. Pontos: i.e., Pontus Euxinus. The Black Sea,
with its current moving steadily on, indicates how it is possible sor the
aether to preserve a continuous and uniform movement.

2. The explanation of astronomical phenomena.
509-770.

ne poet takes up in order the motions of the stars, the relation of the
earth to the world, the size (ff the heavenly bodies, the nature qf the sun,
the alternatim and variatim in length of day and night, the source ‹ffthe
moon’s lzgrht, and the cause of eclipses.

(1) The motions os the stars are caused by currents of air, or by tides
qf aether, or perchance by search forfood. 509- 53 3.

509-533. Having shown in a general way how from a concourse of
atoms the world was formed, the poet proceeds to explain those phe-
nomena of the heavens which are most mysterious and impressive,
and are thought to point to the guiding and staying power of a deity.
This first part about the starS, however, is evidently not in close con·
nection with what precedes and follows; for this reason it is bracketed
by both Lachmann and Munro. It furnishes additional evidence
of the incomplete state in which the poem was left by its author.
511 et seq. ‘We must say that an air presses on the pole at each
extremity‚ and on the outside holds it in and closes it in at both
ends; then that a third air streams above and flows in the same di-
rection in which the stars of the etei-nal world go, shining as they
roll 3· or else that the third air streams below, in order to carry up the
sphere in the contrary direction‚' etc. 511. polum : here seems

ξ to mean the axis of the heavens, about which they revolve. Against
¹¹ the ends of this two air-currentS, steadily blowing, keep the heavens
