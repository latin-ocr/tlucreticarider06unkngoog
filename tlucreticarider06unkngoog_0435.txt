covery, probably the greatest, excepting language, made by mar-1,
dates from before the dawn of history.'’ On the significance of the
use of fire see Lange, ‘ Hist. of Materialism,’ iii. 96. 1012. The
break in construction is probably caused by the dropping out of a
verse, which Munro thus supplies:

hospitium, ac lecti socialia iura duobus,

Lachmann reads conubium, Bernays coniugium, for cognita sunt, with-
out further change. Lucr. knows of no intermediate polygamy and
polyandry preceding monogamy. See Morgan, ‘Ancient Society' ;
Darwin, ‘Descent of Man,' ii. 345. Notwithstanding the beneficial
effects ascribed to marriage here, the Epicureans professed not to
believe in it ; cf. Diog. Laert. 10, IIS-9 ‘ Marriage, they say, is never
any good to a rnan3 one ought to be content if it does no harm3
moreover the wise man will never marry or beget children, as Epicurus

1028 et seq. To language as mal-king a step in the progress of the
race Lucr. attaches great importance. With the view here presented
cf. Epicurus Diog. Laert. 10, 75 ‘ Words in⁰the beginning did not
originate by express agreement; but the very natures of men in the
case of each people experiencing peculiar feelings and having peculiar
ideas expelled the air accordingly, thus expressing different feelinssgs
and ideas differently, just as the people differed in location and sur-
