earth the poet proceeds at once to trace the course of the human
race. In showing how it deveIoped, in a natural way and from purely

overthrows the popular notions of his time about the reign of Saturn
on earth, and about the aid of the gods in bestowing on mankind
inventions and the means of progress3 as Prometheus was fabled to

et documenta damus qua simus origine nati.

Cf. also Verg. Georg. 1, 63 unde (i.e. ex lapidibus) homines nati, durum
genus. For a scientific discussion of the relative endurance and power
of man in the primitive and man in the present condition see Spencer
ut sup. ch. 5. 929-930. An allusion to the fact early noticed that
man is the only animal adapted to life in the extremes οἱ either heat
or cold. and on all kinds of food. 933 et seq. Similar expressions
were often employed in describing the Golden Age; cf. n. to 820 and
