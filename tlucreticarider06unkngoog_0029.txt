LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xxv

his hands both underwent expansion, and were somewhat modi-
fied. He saw that if atoms are assumed to be of an infinite
number of shapeS, some may be infinitely large, which would be
inconsistent with the belief that the atoms are invisible. He
held, therefore, that the shapes of atoms are finite in number,
but that the atoms of each form are numberless. Observing,
moreover‚ that in a vacuum all bodies must fall equally fast
in parallel lines, he rejected the teaching that in the void the
beavier atoms falling strike the lighter3 he supposed that the
smaller atoms swerve a little from a straight downward course,
and that thus by mutual entanglement a world nucleus is formed.1
The cause of the swerving to one side he assigned not to the
operation of the law of necessity, but to a sort of inherent
power, an originative impulse of motion in the atoms them-
selves3 in this he found the origin of the power of free move-
ment‚ and the source of the freedom of the human will.
Epicurus, moreover‚ believed in gods3 but he denied them all
concern in the changes of'things.2 In ethics he differed from
the Cyrenaics regarding the nature of happiness: He did not
limit it to a continuance or succession of pleasurable sensationS,
but found it also in perfect freedom of the body from pain and
the soul from care or anxiety. He thus recognized anegative
as well as positive side of happiness. He enlarged upon the
Cyrenaics' doctrine of pleasure as the supreme good, and empha-
sized as much as they the rational put-suit of it. The sage will
be a careful reckoner of pains and pleasures. All actions in
which the pains are going to predominate he will refrain from3
all which involve the more pleasure he will engage in. The·
remaining doctrines of Epicurus may be best considered in
discussing the presentation of his philosophy by LucretiuS.⁸
