280 LUCRE‘rms [1. 863ss

863. ossa: i.e.‚ corpora parva, or corpuscula, ossium. — partis: i.e.‚
particulas. 864. liquor: for liquidus (cibus). 865. alienigenis:
·’ different in kind,' ‘foreign in kind,’· the opposite, as Munro remarks,
to ὀμοιομερής. The argument is, that food does not consist of minute
particles of like nature with itself, as the doctrine of Anax. requires,
but of particles os blood, bone, etc„ things foreign to it in kind. And
likewise the earth is composed not of minute portions of earth, but
of particles that go to make up all the things that grow out of it. So
again in wood {lame-particles lurk. 868. terris: the pl. brings out
the idea of ‘ parts ' or ‘ portions of earth ’ς ‘ earths.' 870. transfer:
imper. for protasis of cond. sentence, ⁴ apply ’ (i.e. if you apply) the
same reasoning. 873-4 These lines, as they stand, are meaning-

less. Lachmann reads 874

ex alienigeniS, quae alienigenis oriuntur,

which is not at all clear3 Munro supposes that after 873 there is
a break, which he thus bridges over, simply adding his to 874 as it
stands in the Mss:

ex alienigenis quae tellure exoriuntur.
s‘ic itidem quae ligna emittunt corpora, aluntur
ex alienigeni5‚ quae lignis his oriuntur.

This, at least, makes good sense and completes the argument.

But Anaxagoras assumes that while in things all sorts of substances
are mingled, only that becomes apparent of which tlte particles are most
numerous and conspicuous ; the others, as it were, lie hid. Quite wrong.
For, on thes supposition, when things are crus-hed, minute particles os

different substances ought to appear. 87 5—896.

875. ‘ Here some slight opportunity is given for evasion.’ —tenvist
a dissyllable, as often in poetry. 878. plurima: supply corpora
parva or corpuscula. 881. conveniebat: trans. as if subj.; so 884
decebat. A. 311, c ,· G. 246, Rem. 13 H. 476, 4. 883. aliquid: sup-
ply eorum. 885. lapidi: abl. 886. latices: i.e.‚ “ the waters
that the sheep drink.'’ 887. Lachmann, followed by Munro, thus
explains the constr.: dulces guttas mittere (talep) quali oves sunt ubere
lactis5 “ ubere is briefly said for sapore uberis.’¹ 892. praefr.
forent: observe the subj., while above in 882 franguntur and 885
