dense, by the dissolution of which all things embraced in it will be
involved in destruction. Cf. Plut. Plac. 2, 7, 3. This limit or envelop-
ing sphere Lucr. identified with the aether, in which, as the outer place,
the lighter‚ fiery elements of the world gathered. See 5, 454—494 and
nn.; cf. also 2, 1066. By mundi here the poet probably means the
world, not the universe (for which mundus was often used by the
StoicS, but never by the Epicureans) nor the heavens. The Epicu-
reans believed in an infinite number of worlds3 see Lucr. 2, 1052
et seq. “ Epicurus carried himself in thought beyond this visible uni-
verse, and well knew that there are innumerable other worlds besides
the one we inhabst, and that the heaven does not form the extreme'
boundary· of the whole nature of thingS.'' Dr. Mosheim’s note on
Cudworth’s ‘ Intellectual System of the Universe,’ iii. 481. The Sto-
ics taught that the world and the universe are the same, — a compact
sphere, bounded by aether, outside of which space extended on all
sides to infinity. See n. to 958. Cf. Manilius 1, 194 et seq.; Plin.
N. H. 2, 1, 1. 74. omne immensum: ‘the immeasurable uni-
verse'; omne, as often in Lucr., = τὸ πᾶν, ‘the universe,' as dis-
tinguished from mundus. —mente animoque: see n. on 3, 94.
75-77. ⁶ Whence as conqueror he brings back report of what can
rise into existence, what cannot3 in short, on what principle for each
thing its powers and limit deeply fixed have been marked offg' These
·lines are repeated with slight changes 1, 594-63 5, 88-90; 6, 64—66ss
Infinite power can only be conceived of as an attribute of the Di-
vine: hence, perhapS, the poet’s anxiety to impress the thought that
everything is limited, finite; that there is no infinite power in any-
thing. ·
79. opteritur: no rule can be laid down as to the assimilation of b

before t. Cf. 6, 92 praescribta. — exaequat etc.: This position of the
Epicureans is suggestive of the parallel the Stoics were fond of draw-

·ing between the wise man and the gods. Cf. Sen. De Prov. 1, 5 bonus
tempore tantum a deo deffert,· see also Ep. Mor. 73, 11-14 ; Epic.
Dis. 1, 12, 26. The Epicurean doctrine, however, was based upon the
belief that gods as well as men are of limited powerS, and that men
are practically the highest existences; the Stoic, upon this, that the
gods are like men subject to fate 3 and that the wise man, being pos-
sessed of reason, has in himself all resources for ‘living happily and
well) Could even a god be more independent than that? Both con-
ceptions reflect the anthropomorphic tendency of the ancient Greek
