world is of quite recent formation, and again that it not only can but Χ
must and will be destroyed in a moment of time. What then be-
comes of this unvarying equality‚ at least thus unconditionally applied,

ii. ELEMENTAL BARTS OF THE UNIVERSE, MATTER
AND Vom.

1. Matter exists, composed of Invisible ParticleS,
’ the AtomS. 265-328.

This is shown by a number ofillustrations, drawn from the wind (271-
297) 3 smells, beat, cold and sounds (298-304) ; the moisture that collects
in garments spread out near‘tlze sea ( 305-310) ; the imperceptible wearing
away offinger-rings, plough-shares, pavements‚ statues near the city gates
(311-321) ; the unseen processes os growth and decay (322-328).

265. Nunc age ε ‘n'ow heed,' a common expression in Lucr.‚ mark.
ing a transition to a new topic. 267. nequa: often written ne qua.
269. tute: emphatic for tu. Cf. 102 tutemet and n. 270. confite-
are : necessest confiteare is a formula frequently met with in Lucr. For
constr. see A. 331, f, Rem.; H. 502, 1. Necessest· is also followed by
the infin.‚ a} 302.-—esse = existere, as ostem—videri: passive.
271. portus: for cortus of MSS. Lachmann has cautes. Munro de-
fends the reading portus on the ground that ‘⁸ the wind beats against
them (the harbors), and prevents all ingress to ships; rendering them,
therefore, more dangerous than the open sea.’' ο 272. ruit: ruere in
Lucr. is several times transitive, a use rare except in poetry. Cf. 1,
289 and 2923 5, 1325 ; 6, 726. 275. silvifragis: found only here.
Lucr. displayed boldness and power in the formation of new com-
pounds. Some of them became fixed in Latin speech. Among the
new words may be mentioned terriloquis (1, 103) 3 fluctifrago (1, 305) 3
rarefieri (1, 648); auctifici (2, 571) ; pennipotentum (2, 878; 5, 789);
primigenum (2, 1106); sensiferos ( 3, 240); cinefactum (3, 9o6); tri·
pectora (5, 28); levisomna ( 5, 864); frug-sparos (6, Ι) ; confervefacit
(6, 353); vacefit (6, 10053 6, 1017); patefiet (6, 1001). 277. caeca:
‘hidden,’ ‘ invisible), 278: see n. on 6 caeli etc. 281. et: used
as a particle of comparison, ‘ than ’ς cf. 2, 416. In this sense ac (atque)
