552-] NOTES 315

because the cure of mental troubles is just as readily accounted for on
the supposition that the mind is a spirit that manifests itself and acts
through the medium of the body; when the body is diseased its mani-
festations are disordered‚ but when this becomes sound again they are
righted. Medicine thus affects the body only, the mind not at all.
Cf. Baxter‚ ⁴ An Enquiry,' etc., i. 383 et seq. 513. traiecere: an
intermediate form between traiacere and traicere, several times found
in mss—aecumst: see n. to 476. 5¹4- hilum: see n. to 220.
Supply illum as acc. to detrahere and the preceding infinitives.
519-520. Cf. 1, 67o-1 and n. 521. mortalia: i.e., indicating that
it is mortal. On the position of mortalia . . . docui between the sive
. . . seu clauses see n. to 1, 146. 524. eunti: i.e., one proceeding
to attack the doctrine. 525. ancipiti: interpret from 521-2.—
refutatu: found only here3 for refutatione, like 1, 795 commutatum
for commutationem. Lucr. is fond of these nouus in -us.

(8) Osten the body dies limb by limb ‚· then the soul, dioided, must go
part by part away and be dissolved. If it is urged that as the body
wastes away the soul can draw itset'f together into one place, that spot
ought to be more sensitive than the rest ‚· since nothing such is found to
happen doubtless the soul perishes too. Nay, even suppose the soul can

thus guther itself together ,· still it is mortal, since the dying body grad- ,

ually loses all feeling and li e. 5262 547.

526. Denique τ as in 476. The argument is well refuted by Baxter,
‘ An Enquiry,’ etc., i. pp. 423-5. —ire: ‘ pass away,' a rare use3 akin
to that with expressions of time3 cf. 531, 578. 529. artus: see n.
to 151- 531. itque an. hoc: Munro for atque animo haec ; Lach-
mann writes usque adeo haec. — hoc: ‘ for this reason,' almost =ergv,
Munro thinks. The argument rests upon the assumption that the
soul is disseminated throughout the body and vitally connected with

it. See 143 etseq. 538. qui: i.e., locus. 541. dare: ‘admit.'
545. obbrut. ε ob. in composition often has the force of ‘ completely,’
as here. 546. undique : ‘in every part.'

(9) ne mind is a part of man just as the ears and the eyes and the
other semes ‚· therefore it must, like them, when separated from the body,
lose its fitnctions and decay. 548- 5 57.

548. loco: i.e., media regione in pectoris of 140, where see n. 550.
qui vitam cumque : tmesis. 552. secreta ε see n. to 1, 194 —·
