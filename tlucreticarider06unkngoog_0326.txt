ordine: ‘in succession'3 i.e., one generation after another. 590.
generalis: common to their kind; e.g., bobolinus generation after
generation keep the same marking of white and black. 592.

debent: for subject refer back to omnia. 594-7. Cf. 7 5—7 and n.
597. referre: ‘reproduce.' Cf. 4, 1218-9.

As atoms, which lie beyond tlte ken of sense, are parts os things, so the
atoms themselves are composed os parts ‚· but with this dgfference. The
parts of the atom are absolutely limited in sz'ze and are.t'nseparable from
one another, having existed in union from all eternity, so that the atom
cannot be broken up, but remains a unit ( 599-614). Furtlzermore, is the
atom were infinitely dtwlu’ble there would be no dffrence between the
least thing and the greatest, since both alike would be com posed of infinite
parts, and thus be equal (615-627) ; ff the atom were de‘zlided into the
least parts, these could not ssave the properties which matter, to form the
basis of existent ‘,e must have (628-634).

599-608 This passage is exceedingly difficul t. Munro' s explanation

'⁸ is the best. After 599 he thinks two lines have been lost, and thus fills

out the sense. ‘Then again, since there is ever a bounding- -point [to
bodies, which appears to us to be a least, there ought‘ 1n the same way
to be a bounding-point the least conceivable] to that first body, which
is already beyond what our senses can perceive z that point sure enough
is without parts ' etc. 6οο. corporis : i.e., the atom. On the view
that the atom can be known not by sense but by reason, see Zeller,
‘ Prae.-Socrat. Phil: ii. 219, 22 5 ancl nn. with references to original au-
thoritie83 Id. ‘StoicS, Ep.. and Scep.' p. 442. cf. Tyndall, ⁴ Frag. of
Sci.’ p. 71 ε “ Indeed the domain of the senses in Nature is almost in·
finitely small in comparison with the vast region to thought which lies
beyond them.” 601. id ε i.e. cacumen .· ‘ it has no partS, but is itself
one of the parts of the atom, having no conceivable existence apart from
the atom.' — extat : = est. 604-5. ⁸ and so a first and single part,
and then other and other similar parts in succession, fill up in close
serried mass the nature of the first body’ (corporis, the atom). The
atom is thus divisible only in thought, not in reality. 608. haerere

unde:‘cling to that from which! 610. arte: adv. 611. illarum.
Munro’s emend. for illorum. 613. unde: =a quibus, ie., a pri.
mordiis. 614. semina. supply ea or ea esse.

615. parvissima· the regular superlative of parvus is rare; it here
takes the place of mi'mma because minimum is used in a technieaJ
