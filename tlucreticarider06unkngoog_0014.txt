age at forty-four at the time of death, he was born late in Β. c.
99 or in the earlier part of 98.

The name Lucretius was famous in Roman annals from an
early date. The stock, or family, to which it belonged was
primarily patrician, but in the poet's day had at least three ple-
beian brancheS, all of good standing, with the sui-names GalluS‚
Ofella, and Vespillo. 1t is known from coins that there was a
Lucretius Tri0‚ who was probably of plebeian parentage. The
patrician Lucretii had the sumame Tricipitini, but gave to
history no distinguished character after the third century Β. c.
The name Carus is not found elsewhere coupled with Lucretius.1
But Titus, as Munro has noticed,2 was a not infrequent praeno-
men among the Lucretii Tricipitini3 this slight clue perhaps
makes it probable that from them the poet sprung. That his
rank was high is evident from the poem itself. He was thor-
oughly imbued with the culture of the time3 and education was
then a boon in the.reach only of the upper classes. In his dedi-
cation he addresses the well-known and influentia] Memmius
as friend and equa] 3⁸ not with the tone of inferior to patron, as
of Horace to Maecenas. Scenes of luxury are familiar to him3
and he touches on them not with the air of a novice in high lise,
but of one who had always been in the midst of elegant sur-
roundings.4 Regarding the circumstances of his education and
the moulding influences of his life, as we know absolutely noth-
ing, it is idle to speculate.

The story of Lucretius’ madness has been much enlarged .
upon, and has surrounded his name with a romantic halo.⁵·
Possibly it is a myth, framed and circulated by those envious
of his ability and hostile to his doctrine. At any rate, no men—
tion seems to have been made of it before the time of SuetoniuS‚
from whom doubtless Jerome drew his account.⁶ Indeed the
