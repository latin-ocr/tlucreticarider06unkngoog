iv PREFACE.

text or notice in the commentary the numerous transpositions
of lines suggested by Munro, because they are a source of
confusion to any but the critical scholar. Most students,
and general readers as well, prefer a text in either prose
or poetry free from all marks not needful for convenient

reference.
The introduction was prepared with the design of offering

some suggestions regarding the personality of Lucretius, his
mission in philosophy, and his rank as a poet. In the notes
it has been the editor’s aim not simply to explain the more
difficult word-forms and constructionS, but also to bring· out
the philosophie import of the passages annotated in the
light of both ancient and modern thought. Most classica]
writings have an interest for us mainly because of the general
human clement in them, — because they crystallize in artistic
. form something that appeals to thinking men of all times and
of all nations. But Lucretius stands in close relation with
the life of the present. His work is not lacking in the power
and finish that mark the true poet, ——one the duration of
whose fame is to be measured not by decades, but by
centuries. At the same time his verse is the vehicle of a
philosophie system, which, recurring from time to time In
the speculations of the past, has only in the present genera-
tion found its fullest development and exposition, and its
widest application. The* De⁴ Rerum Natura reveals its
deepest significance only when studied in connection with

the thought of to-day.
