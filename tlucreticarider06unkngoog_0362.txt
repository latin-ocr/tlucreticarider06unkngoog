300 LUCRETIUS [111. 136-

2. The mind and soul are inseparably
united. 136-160.

’ We mind and soul are united, making one nature ; but the mind is

the directing part and is situated in the mid-region of the breast, while the
soul ic diffused throughout the body. Sometimes the mind seels when tlte

soul remains unmoved ,· but when tlte mind is deeply stirred, the soul too
is affected, and with it the whole body. 136-160.

136. animam ε All through here by anima ‘soul ' the poet means
the life-principle, through which the body feeIS, and through which the
mind sends its directing impulse to the limbs. See n. to 94. In ani-
mus and anima is the distinction, maintained also by the Stoics‚
between the rational and the irrational soul, the reason and the vital
principle. For the view of Aristotle see Ritter, ‘ Hist. of Anc. Phil!
iii. ch. 43 Grote‚ ‘Aristotle‚’ ch. 123 for that of the Stoics‚ Zeller,
‘ StoicS‚ Ep„ and Scep.’, ch. 93 for that of EpicuruS, Id. ch. 17, c (2).

Ἰ 139. See n. to 94. 140. That sensation and intellectual activ-
Ι. ity have their centre in and about the heart was the doctrine alike

of Peripatetics‚ Stoics‚ and Epicureans. The brain was reckoned of

. only secondary importance. Democritus taught that anger alone

i arises in the beart, while thought has its origin in the brain, and

desire in the liver. With 140 cf. Epicurus’ statement in Diog. Laert.
10, 66 καὶ τὸ μέντοι αὐτῆς (i.e., τῆς ψυχῆς) ἄλογον εἶναι, ὃ τῷ namq?
παρεσπάρη σώματι · τὸ δὲ λογικόν, ὃ ἐν τῷ θώρακι, ὥς δῆλον ἔκ τε τῶν
φόβων καὶ τῆς χαρᾶςς also Cic. Tusc. Disp. 1, 9, 19 aliis pars quaedam
cerebri visa est animi principatum tenere ‚· aliis nec cor ipsum placet nec
cerebri quandam panem esse animum ,⁶ sed alii in corde, alii in cerebro
dixerunt animi esse sedem et locum. 141. pavor ac metus: pavor
is the quaking fear of that which is present or near, menes the anxious
dread of that which is in the future. 142. laetitiae: the pl. of
this word is very rare.—ergo etc.: a striking instance of insufficient
induction. 143. cet. pars: part of the soul is in and of the mind;

the rest is diffused through the body. 144. numen: ‘beck.'—
movetur: see n. to 1, 421. 145. idque: same as idque of 140,
referring to consilium of 139. 146. res: i.e., through the senses.—-
una: adv. 151. artus: ‘frame.' 152. vementi: vehemens

is pronounced as two syllables in verse, whether written in full or
