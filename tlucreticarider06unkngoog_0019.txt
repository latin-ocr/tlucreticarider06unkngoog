LUCRETIUS AS A MAN xv

Yet the poet had little saith that his efforts to free men from
their bondage would ever reach or aid them. Gloomily he came
to think that they do not wish to know the true reason. They
will ever wander in error. An undertone of sadness runs like a
minor chord through the entire poem. Lucretius has been
called, with a certain fitness, the poet of death.¹ But he is not
a pessimist3 he is the poetrof progress.2 He sees indeed a de-
cline in nature’s powers ; ⁸ but in civilization he thought his day
marked the highest goal yet reached! The sense of the misery
and the folly of humanity seemed ever present with him, a dark
cloud brooding over his life.⁶ Indeed it may be doubted whether
Epicureanism‚ with all its boasted delights, is even at the best a
happy system. The keen, reflective mind that would grapple
with the fundamental realities of being can hardly find much to
cheer or comfort in the doctrine of a world without a divine will,
duty with no guide but sels-centred pleasure,⁶ death everlasting;
and it sees that those who profess belief in these things show a
marked tendency to fall into revolting sels-indulgence& Then‚

folk-character that in its view of life and duty was stern, un-
yielding‚ the very opposite of all that is light and joyous. To

is a fitting prelude to life’s miserie3.'¹ All things are ever the
same.⁸ There is only a circumscribed round of joys3 when this
is complete& better die and return to eternal slumber than live
a life with no new pleasure.⁹

In Lucretius we find an earnest soeeker after truth. He

paused before· the facts of being to question why, whence, '

whither. Having found what he thought the true theory of
things, he devoted himself to it with all the enthusiasm of an
ardent and refined nature, clothed it with the poetic forms of a
