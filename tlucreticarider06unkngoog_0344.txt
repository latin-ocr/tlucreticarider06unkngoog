see n. to 136. 923. thyrso: the poet speaks of himself under the
imagery of one at the Bacchic festival roused to inspired frenzy by
the touch of the wreath·girt spear or pole the devotees of the wine·
god carried. — laudis spes : in antiquity, desire of praise was reck-
oned a chief and proper motive of conduct. Several ancient writers
speak of it as a ruling power in directing the lives of the greatest
men3 Cicer0, in particular, confesses his own love of glory3 and in
several places emphasizes the common argument for the immor-
tality of the soul, that the dead continue to exert an active influence
on the living in order to keep alive their fame. Cf. n. to 412-7.

924. mi: for mihi. 925. instinctus: ‘inspired’; often used with
reference to a divine influence. Cf. Quin. 12, 10, 24 instinctis· divino
spiritu vatibus. 926. Pieridum: i.e., the Muses. Some say this

name was given them from PieruS, an early king of Thrace, who went
to Boeotia and there established their worship. More likely, how-

That with no middle ssight intends to soar
Above the Aonian mount, while it pursuoe
Things unattempted yet in prose and thyme.”

928—930. In like manner Horace tells of how he brought new honors
to the Latin tongue, and glory to himself, by introducing the Greek
measures3 and Cicer0, more than once, speaks οἱ his mission as the
first expounder of the Greek philosophy to his fellow-countrymen.
Perhaps these lines suggested Hor. od. '1, 7, 5⁴7 ε -

932. Part of this line is quoted by Lactantius (De Ver. Sap. 4, 28)
to sustain his derivation ot* reltgio from relegare, in opposition to the
