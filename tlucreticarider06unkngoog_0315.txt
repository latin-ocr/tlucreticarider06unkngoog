sti'tirunt and the like could not stand in hexameter verse3 but the
choice of the form with short e was not altogether determined by
the metre3 cf. 5, 474 suh-unt. In the time of Lucretius irunt was
undoubtedly still a current pronunciation. 407. alid: see n. to
263. 409. insinuare: see n. to 113.—inde:=ex cis. 410.
pigraris: not from pegror, but contr. for pagravertlu the deponent
form is found but once, Cic. Att. 14, 1, 2. The mood of ngrr. and
reces is of course subj —· ab re: ‘from the subject.' 411. de
plano: a phrase from the law-conns, referring to decisions rendered
informally anywhere, as distinguished from those ex loco superiore,
i. e., from the elevated seat of the judge in formal trial. Out of
the technical meaning ‘off the bench,’ ‘ informally,’ came the use
here,=‘readily,' ‘easily.' 412—417. In antiquity the display of
firm seli-confidence was reckoned almost a virtue. Livy says of Rom-
ulus (1, 10) cum fizctis vir magnificus tum fizctorum ostentator hautminor,
a characterization that well exemplifies the Roman spirit. In philos-
ophy the earlier Stoics and Epicureans showed an uncompromising
dogmatism‚ which, professing to know the whole truth, treated with
contempt all theories but their own. Among the poets the same spirit
was manifested for the most part in bold prophecies of immortality
for their productions3 Ennia-5, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Propertius, and
Martia] foretold the honors that posterity would pay to them. So, too,
Shakespere has said,—

“ Not marble nor the gilded monuments
of pn'nces shall outlast this powersul rhyme.

In Lucr. there was no touch of vanity or overweening sels-assertion.
Fired by his great design of freeing men from the ills of superstition,
and fully believing that he had found the truth, he went boldly to pro-
claiming ‘ the true reason ’ as the greatest boon and blessing. Cf. 1,
92¹·9503 2, 730. 412. fontibu’ ε see n. on 159 omnibu'. The ref-
erence in sont. mag. is to the abundant teachings and writings of Epi·
curus. Cf. n. to 3, 10. 413. pectore: see n. to 3. 140. 415.
vitai claustra: ‘life’s fastnesses.’ Cf. 3, 396; 6, 1153. 416. tibi:
a loose use of the dat. with the predicate as a whole, where a pronom-
inal adj. (tuas) might have been expected. 417. sit . . . missa: for
the mood see A. 3275 H. 520. — eopia: ‘store.‘
