iii. EPICUREANISM As sm· FoRTH ΒΥ Lucam-1113.

Lucretius followed Epicurus as unet-ring guide.1 In his poem,
however, he did not attempt to expound the whole Epicu· ·
rean philosophy. Having in view a definite aim,2 he set forth
only those portions of Epicurus’ teachings necessary to the
attainment of it. He treats in detail only the views on nature,
striving by his theory of the universe and the development of
civilization⁸ to banish all fear of the godS‚ and by his proof of
the mortality of the soul to dispel the dread of death. Inter-
spersed with his physical doctrineS‚ however, there are many
ethical reflections 4 that give an insight into his views of life and
duty. If the lost work of Epicurus ‘On Nature ' ⁵ were extant,
doubtless Lucretius' poem throughout would be found to bear a
close resemblance to it. Whatever the poet teaches may be
accepted as also the doctrine of his master3 only when carried

away with poetic inspiration does he step out of the beaten
track of the school to which he belonged-⁶ Lucretius' exposi-

tion may be conveniently treated under four headS, —theory of
knowledge, theory of the universe, theory of organic life, view
of man!

1. Lucretius' Theory of Knowledge.

Knowledge of things is gained through the senses, These
never err3 upon them depends all reasoning.⁸ From the surface
of things films of matter, the idols or imageS‚ are continually
thrown off. They are exceedingly thin, of exactly the same
